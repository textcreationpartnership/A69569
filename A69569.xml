            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The most Humble</hi> Confession <hi>of the most unworthy</hi> Reader <hi>in these</hi> Prophesies <hi>of</hi> Jesus Christ.</head>
            <p>HAving so Fully, so Faithfully, so Truly, prepar'd to give the Severest senses of <hi>Prophecy</hi> concerning so Honourable, and Valuable Things, as the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the <hi>Reformed Churches;</hi> It becomes me first to <hi>Roll my self,</hi> as in the <hi>Dust,</hi> with Greatest Humility, and self Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence; and to Remember with <hi>Confusion of Face</hi> my own Great offences, and to Acknowledge the Just, and Righteous Hand of God upon me in my Confinement; and to Aggravate against my self the Just <hi>Scandal</hi> of my Great <hi>Ʋnrighteousnesses,</hi> (from which I am no way able to Redeem my self in my present state) contracted chiefly through that Great sin, and Evil of Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>vain Glory</hi> of this <hi>World;</hi> I with Greatest self Abasement Acknowledge the just <hi>Offence,</hi> that may hence arise against my <hi>Christian Profession, Ministery,</hi> and particularly in these <hi>Prophesies;</hi> and so shall by his Assistance most pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently bear the sharpest, and most Aculeate Reflexions upon my self, or this work, as it proceeds from me, and whatever I might say, return only Acknowledgments.</p>
            <p>I do most Humbly beg pardon of All the <hi>Servants of Christ,</hi> of All Men, and most especially of Those, whom I have most particularly sinned against, both as a <hi>Just Due</hi> to them, and also in order to the <hi>Divine Forgiveness;</hi> But principally I <hi>Bow my Knees</hi> to the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Mercies,</hi> and <hi>Forgivenesses</hi> thro' the Great <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> For in the Supream sense; <hi>Against Him, Against Him have I sinned,</hi> and <hi>done these Evils in his sight,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 4.</note> who only can so Supreamly <hi>Forgive,</hi> as therein to be <hi>Justified,</hi> when He <hi>Speaketh,</hi> and to be <hi>Clear when He Judgeth,</hi> though Men may not <hi>Forgive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But All this Evil notwithstanding God hath been pleas'd to Encline, and to Enable my Re-searches into <hi>Prophecy</hi> in this <hi>Wilderness</hi> Condition; A Mercy to be Acknowledg'd to the <hi>Freeness, Richess,</hi> and un-accountableness of his <hi>Grace,</hi> which Triumphs, as it pleases over Guilt in the <hi>Chief of Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am far yet from looking, upon what He hath herein Enabled me, as any <hi>Assurance</hi> of his saving <hi>Grace;</hi> I sadly Remember the man whose <hi>Eyes were open,</hi> and who <hi>Heard the words of the most High,</hi> and yet did not <hi>Dye the death of the Righteous,</hi> nor was his <hi>Latter end,</hi> as <hi>His;</hi> but <hi>Died in his Sin</hi> as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the People of whose Glory He declar'd; <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 3. 4. <hi>c.</hi> 31. 8. I consider what the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, that the <hi>Gift of Prophecy</hi> and <hi>Ʋnderstanding all Mysteries</hi> without <hi>Love,</hi> and so without <hi>Righteousness, profits nothing,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Testimony</hi> I have within me by his <hi>Grace,</hi> that I have in All Things written Faithfully, according to the Light I have Receiv'd, (even in the Late <hi>Reign</hi> so <hi>Perillous</hi> to such Expositions of <hi>Prophecy;)</hi> that I most Affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Love,</hi> and desire the Approaching <hi>Kingdom</hi> of our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> that I Heartily Love, and Honour all his Holy Servants of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> of what distinction soever therein; although I have in any of their Representations not varied the least from <hi>Prophecy</hi> according to what was <hi>Given</hi> to me.</p>
            <p>I am also most Assured in the Evidence of <hi>Divine Light</hi> vouchsaf'd to me, I am misled from Truth in no main Point; And that All Things will Answer in their <hi>own Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If now it shall please God to Humble me into the Lowest of a <hi>Sackcloth Condition,</hi> and to enable me with his <hi>Grace,</hi> I shall not Refuse the Life of <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> during <hi>Davids</hi> Absence from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> upon the Conspiracy of <hi>Absalom,</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> till his <hi>Return;</hi> which was a <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>

            <head>The Preface to the Hearers of Prophecy.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have so presented the Following <hi>Prophetic History</hi> of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> that I Foresee, I shall please none of the <hi>Reformed,</hi> that are Hot, and Intemperate in their <hi>Zeal</hi> for a <hi>Party;</hi> But I hope, I shall be Recommended to the <hi>Consciences</hi> of All; and to the Acceptation of Those, who are of a Largness of Spirit, Commensurate to the Love, and Regard of <hi>Christ</hi> to all the <hi>Churches of the Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For I have closely followed the Guidance of the <hi>Prophetic Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols,</hi> and started neither to the <hi>Right Hand,</hi> nor to the <hi>Left</hi> from them, for either Fear, Favour, or Affection; I can truly say in the presence of God, I did not design before Hand, what to say; but as I receiv'd from the <hi>Prophecy</hi> in its whole <hi>Analogy,</hi> what to <hi>Speak;</hi> I have in All Things endeavour'd so to <hi>Speak</hi> even according to those Characters compar'd together, that <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> had so long ago engraven; And I cannot but be perswaded who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever considers, will see it by my care to weigh every the smallest Notice of such a Character, and to be led along by it, neither bowing it contrary to it self, nor Balking its proper Tendencies: But so far as I could obtain Light from the <hi>Word,</hi> and Assistance from the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy, whither that was to go,</hi> I have <hi>gone;</hi> and <hi>gone straight forward,</hi> and have neither <hi>Diverted,</hi> nor <hi>Returned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Would not presume to say, if any one be <hi>offended, let Him be offended;</hi> But I must say to All so <hi>offended,</hi> whether it be <hi>Right to please God,</hi> or to <hi>please Men, judge ye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And surely the Observation of <hi>Prophetical Types</hi> above 1600 Years old, and Matters of Fact following them, as it were on the <hi>King's High way,</hi> without any Turning; must be as great an Argument, that the Interpretation is of God; as it was to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines of old,</hi> an Argument of the <hi>Hand of God</hi> upon them, for detaining the <hi>Ark;</hi> when the <hi>Kine,</hi> that <hi>drew</hi> the <hi>Cart,</hi> loaden with the <hi>Ark</hi> took the straight way to <hi>Bethshemesh</hi> or into the <hi>Land of Israel,</hi> as to its own proper place. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:100645:6"/>
            <p> It is certain <hi>Prophecy</hi> is like a writing in <hi>Cyphar,</hi> or generally unknown <hi>Characters;</hi> and not only so, but in <hi>Mystical,</hi> and <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphical</hi> Figures for persons, and Things; Now what Greater Assurance can there be? And it is an Assurance that satisfies; that any one hath found a <hi>Key,</hi> when He <hi>De-cyphars</hi> so, as to make a Coherent sense to arise from the Agreement of those <hi>Characters</hi> among themselves; and in Agreement with the Counsels, and Design, and Action of the Persons, between whom the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence is; and adjusted to every Person, and Action, that can be suppos'd, such a writing should referr to; first, by the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi> leading to them; and then by the Knowledge, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are, or may be so concern'd, as those <hi>Characters</hi> guide to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend of them, and of their Actions.</p>
            <p>Now if any should say, we have always had other Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as suppose, of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> then according to these <hi>Prophetic Symbols</hi> offer'd concerning it; It is then to be consider'd, when those Characters standing in the midst of such Characters, as we bave great Assurance of; as of the Time, when it began, the measures which it Attain'd, and the continuing state of it; such Former Sentiments must be over-ruled by them, even as such a writing in <hi>Cyphar,</hi> leading us to any other Thought of Persons, then we have heretofore had, would change those former Thoughts; when All the Concurrences of those <hi>Mystical Letters,</hi> and the Coheren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of sence according to them, urge us to it.</p>
            <p>Besides we are always to consider, the <hi>Thoughts of God</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Things are not as our <hi>Thoughts;</hi> and we should have had other Thoughts of many persons, and Things, if <hi>Humane History</hi> had drawn their Portraictures, then we now must needs have, as the Divine Hand hath given Them; And so it must be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Reformation;</hi> The <hi>Prophetic History</hi> must needs give us clearer Light, then <hi>Humane</hi> can; and yet when we have Read it in <hi>Divine,</hi> we may find <hi>Humane History</hi> much more agreeiag in the Reasons of the <hi>Divine,</hi> then we could have imagin'd, had not <hi>Divine Light</hi> given us Ʋnderstanding in both.</p>
            <p>That the method therefore in which I have proceeded may be better understood, I shall here present a Brief Table of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. After a Brief Introduction p. 1. p. 2. I undertake the proofs, that the <hi>Tenth Chapter of the Apocalyptical Prophecy</hi> is a most solemn <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> this I argue from p. 3. to p. 13.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:100645:6"/> 2. I then observe the <hi>Types,</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> according to the <hi>Vision,</hi> to be of Two sorts, 1. <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Appearance</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ, 2. Types</hi> of that <hi>Kingdom Estopp'd;</hi> and that according to what we know in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact concerning the <hi>Reformation,</hi> the <hi>Vision</hi> ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of both: These Two sorts of <hi>Types</hi> are discours'd from p. 13. to p. 19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I come then to consider that singular <hi>Type; viz.</hi> the Time of this <hi>Vision,</hi> which is Inlay'd with that <hi>Oath</hi> in it; <hi>Time shall be no more;</hi> the precise Time of which I endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate by a compare of the <hi>Oath</hi> in the <hi>Vision</hi> with that <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half a Time, Dan.</hi> 12. and from thence to shew, the Time of the <hi>Reformation</hi> was the proper Time of this <hi>Vision;</hi> For the very <hi>Reformation</hi> assures by matter of Fact in it, it might then and not till then be <hi>sworn, Time shall be no more;</hi> And if it could not have been so <hi>sworn</hi> then, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> it self could not have been then according to <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> And because this is of so Mighty concern to the <hi>Visions</hi> being the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> I discourse it so largely, as from p. 19. to p. 39.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I proceed to shew, that the <hi>Reformation</hi> did Actually bear <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Appearance</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> This is with its due Limitations discours'd from p. 39. to p. 43.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I am then under a necessity to shew, we even of the <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches</hi> are oblig'd to humble our selves, to behold the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Estoppage</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> amongst us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And because I know this is an exceeding Tender point, and requires Great Exactness; I first lay together the <hi>Types</hi> of <hi>Estop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,</hi> and then take in the <hi>Vision of the Churches</hi> to our Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and Argue, it ought to be so done; and therein pitch upon the <hi>Three Churches, Thyatyra, Sardis, Philadelphia, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols</hi> of <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> from p. 43. to p. 47.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Having done this, I consider the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> is to succeed the <hi>Feet of Iron,</hi> and the <hi>Feet of Clay,</hi> as in <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars Image;</hi> and then I observe, how it is <hi>Estopp'd</hi> in its succeeding the <hi>Feet of Iron,</hi> both with Relation to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches</hi> under the <hi>Princes,</hi> yet continuing <hi>Popish;</hi> and even under <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> And this is done with due Modesty from p. 47. to p. 50.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I observe further in the <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Church of Thyaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> the <hi>Estoppage</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> as it is to succeed
<pb facs="tcp:100645:7"/> the <hi>Feet of Clay,</hi> or the <hi>Spiritual</hi> (Falsly so call'd) or <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Tyranny</hi> within the <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and <hi>States</hi> still Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to the <hi>Beast;</hi> and how it is <hi>Estopp'd</hi> there, in very s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort, because easie to Apprehend, p. 50.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I come then upon the Tenderest point of the discourse, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> as it is to succeed the <hi>Feet of Clay,</hi> or that <hi>Ecclesiastical Tyranny</hi> under <hi>Reformed Princes,</hi> and how it is there <hi>Estopp'd:</hi> And that I may mannage so nice a point of Discourse with all care.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I lay down 12 preparatory Remarks upon all the <hi>Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Types</hi> both in the <hi>Visions</hi> and in the <hi>Churches</hi> from p. 51. to p. 54.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I find it Requis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te to consider the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Seven Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in the great Truths, they are charg'd with; and that the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ</hi> even in the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> must needs be <hi>Estopp'd</hi> by their <hi>Sealing</hi> from p. 54. to p. 56.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I find it further necessary to make a more distinct Judgment upon the <hi>Book,</hi> that was <hi>Open</hi> and then <hi>Enclos'd</hi> in the <hi>Prophets Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels;</hi> and that the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> must needs be <hi>Estopp'd</hi> by that <hi>Enclosure</hi> of the <hi>Book;</hi> even in the <hi>Churches of the Reformation</hi> from p. 56. to p 60.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Ʋpon this Preparation I proceed to that Great point of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> in the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Two Churches of the Reformation,</hi> and both under <hi>Reformed Princes;</hi> viz. <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> and first to Argue, that the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> consists in <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but that in these <hi>Two Churches Prophecy</hi> hath cross'd its <hi>Hands; Sardis,</hi> wherein it hatb most <hi>Power</hi> hath least <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia</hi> (and <hi>Sardis</hi> also in its <hi>Undefiled Names)</hi> hath least <hi>Power,</hi> but Greatest <hi>Purity;</hi> so the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ,</hi> while Things are thus must needs be <hi>Estopp'd,</hi> as appears by the opposite Parallels of these <hi>Two Churches,</hi> which I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give from p. 60. to p. 64.</p>
            <p>Ʋpon the Parallels of the <hi>Two Churches</hi> of the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> under <hi>Reformed Princes,</hi> I argue, seeing there is nothing betwixt the <hi>Apostasie</hi> having place, and the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> succeeding; There must be some Remainder of the <hi>Apostasie</hi> upon that one of these <hi>Churches,</hi> that is least perfect in the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;</hi> and that withstands that <hi>Church,</hi> that is Highest in the <hi>Reformation:</hi> And that such a Remainder of the <hi>Apostasie</hi> is <hi>Symboll▪d</hi> by the <hi>Synagogue of Sathan;</hi> I make therefore close
<pb facs="tcp:100645:7"/> Research into the nature of the <hi>Synagogue of Sathan,</hi> p. 64. 65. 66.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In the general sense, and Representation of such a <hi>Synagogue,</hi> p. 66. 67:</item>
               <item>2. In the place, such a <hi>Synagogue</hi> could have in the Time of the <hi>Church of Smyrna,</hi> as a <hi>Symbolical Church</hi> about the Time of <hi>Heathenism</hi> desolated, and the <hi>Christian Empire</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from p. 67. to p. 70.</item>
               <item>3. In <hi>Some</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> standing up in defence of that <hi>Synagogue,</hi> so far as to oppose <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> or the Higher <hi>Church of the Reformation</hi> by it, from p. 70. to p. 72.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Hereupon I set the Ballance Even, betwixt the <hi>Reformation</hi> and the Remainder of the <hi>Apostasie</hi> upon it, by Reason of the <hi>Synagogue of Sathan,</hi> from p. 72. to p. 80.</p>
            <p>I conclude the Discourse with Inferential <hi>Corollaries</hi> from p. 80. to the End.</p>
            <p>Having now presented the whole Model of the ensuing discourse, I must most Humbly Appeal to the <hi>Judicious Reader,</hi> whether the Method be not natural, and Argumentative; as also in reading the Treatise of it self, whether <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> do not Rise up and Acknowledge the <hi>Prophesies,</hi> that went of them before.</p>
            <p>And especially in the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> is it not out of all Controversie; That there are some of these <hi>Churches,</hi> that are still under the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of <hi>Antichristianism;</hi> and that they have stood, and do stand to this day against all the violence of their Enemies? and seeing that is so, I Humbly desire the Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reader to consider, whether the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Church of Thyatyra,</hi> and their state do not exactly answer one another, as the Treatise Resembles them?</p>
            <p>Is it not out of measure evident, that the <hi>Churches of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> that are patroniz'd by the Greatest <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and their <hi>Laws,</hi> are nearest to the State, of what may be justly called the <hi>Synagogue</hi> in the days of the <hi>Christian Empire;</hi> and yet high Enemies, and so Truly call'd a <hi>Bulwark</hi> against the <hi>Throne</hi> and <hi>Depths</hi> of <hi>Antichrist</hi> by reason of the Favour of those <hi>Mighty Princes,</hi> and <hi>States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not very well known to us, that those <hi>Churches,</hi> that are most <hi>Reform'd</hi> from the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> as well, as from the <hi>Throne,</hi> and <hi>Depths</hi> are under the <hi>Smallest Names?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not evident to us, that some <hi>Churches of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> have not been under the Favour, and patronage of <hi>Reformed</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100645:8"/>
               <hi>Princes, Nations,</hi> and their <hi>Laws;</hi> and that <hi>They</hi> of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue</hi> have thereupon been severe upon them?</p>
            <p>And is it not Apparent within our own particular Knowledge, that when <hi>They</hi> of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> have Grown too High, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; and have been endeavouring to the utmost, being incited by Those, whose the <hi>Synagogue</hi> most properly is, to <hi>shut</hi> the <hi>Door</hi> of those <hi>Churches, un-established by Law;</hi> call'd by <hi>Prophecy, Philadelphian;</hi> as being only gather'd by mutual Assent; That there hath Appear'd a Providence from Heaven, bringing down <hi>Those of the Synagogue,</hi> so that They have been in Extream danger themselves? Let but our own Recollection of Things within these last Fifty Years Give the Answer herein.</p>
            <p>The Continuance then of Things so much according to the first effect of the <hi>Thunders speaking,</hi> and then <hi>Seal'd;</hi> and most Eminently; That no <hi>Reformed state,</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> that hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd the <hi>Reformation</hi> could ever be perswaded to Relinquish it, or to Receive back the <hi>Papal domination</hi> are to be duely weigh'd. From all which considerations, how great are the Assurances? There is so much a Greater, and more perfect <hi>Reformation</hi> at the end of <hi>Half Time,</hi> Ready to appear, when <hi>All Things</hi> that are <hi>Written</hi> shall be <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For God will <hi>fill up</hi> and <hi>perfect his own works</hi> (which are Imperfect yet) seeing He so earnestly calls upon <hi>Sardis</hi> to <hi>fill up its works;</hi> and on <hi>Thyatyra,</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to <hi>Hold fast what They have,</hi> but till He <hi>comes;</hi> which <hi>coming,</hi> he assures, whenever the Time is, shall not <hi>Tarry,</hi> but be <hi>quickly,</hi> and now the Time is very near.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore with Faith, Patience, Hope, and Prayer, and by particular <hi>self-Reformation,</hi> wait for that Great <hi>Re-Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> of which <hi>Prophecy</hi> gives so great Assurances.</p>

            <head type="sub">Or the Reformation to be Reformed 1697. According to that Divine Table, or Vision of it. Revel. 10.</head>
            <p>I HAVE presented many Things to publick Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the near Approaching <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> I shall at this Time under the Conduct of the <hi>Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie</hi> offer the <hi>Prophetical History</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> in that <hi>Divine Vision,</hi> or Table of it, which we have <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. Because there is nothing that may probably more move, or more as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us concerning that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> than a deep Inspection into this Pourtraicture given by <hi>Inspiration</hi> of the State of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,</hi> or the <hi>Reformation;</hi> (If it shall be found to be so;) or that may more enable us to make the truest Judgment, and to fix the most just Character, far beyond <hi>Humane Story,</hi> or the most Authentick Records of matters of Fact upon that <hi>Reformation,</hi> wherein we All profess our selves so highly concern'd, and so affectionately engag'd, as to defend it with the hazard of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is most dear to us in this World.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100645:9"/>
            <p> When therefore by the close and near Reviews of this <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> we shall find the just Reasons we have to set such an estimate upon the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as an Appearance of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> and yet shall by research into this very same <hi>Vision</hi> find, how far short it is from the near approaching succession of that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> in the days of the <hi>seventh Trumpet,</hi> wherein the <hi>Mystery of God</hi> shall be <hi>finish'd,</hi> much more of the very <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> it self; and that a Time is fixt in this <hi>Vision,</hi> How long this low state shall continue, and upon what accounts the state is so low, and when Things shall move by a much higher Key, I hope by the Blessing of him, who is <hi>on the Throne,</hi> and of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and by the mighty Influences of the <hi>seven Spirits before the Throne,</hi> we may have a much clearer Apprehension of, and more holy passionate Affections for, and desires after the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> to <hi>appear,</hi> and so nigh its Appearing.</p>
            <p>For the due management therefore of so great a Discourse, I lay down this Method.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the foundation of the whole, I will endeavour to make good, that this <hi>Tenth Chapter of the Revelation</hi> is the <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary Table</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> in this Great <hi>prophesie</hi> concerning the Church of Christ under the <hi>New Testament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I will consider the <hi>Types;</hi> or Figures of the <hi>Vision,</hi> and shew, that They are such <hi>Types,</hi> as we know in matter of Fact to be most agreeable, at least upon due Reflection, to the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I will endeavour to Evince; The Time of this Vision does most exactly agree with the Time, wherein the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Protestancy;</hi> (on which word I lay some weight, as most proper to <hi>prophesie;)</hi> according to <hi>prophesie</hi> must begin; and when the present state of it shall end; and this I shall treat of, as a further demonstration this <hi>Vision</hi> must be the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 I will then consider according to the <hi>Types,</hi> and according to matter of fact, the true Elevation of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> and wherein It is a <hi>Symbol of the Kingdom of Christ</hi> making an <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> and giving a pledge of it self; and wherein, and on what Accounts, It bears the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ Estop'd,</hi> or retir'd from that appearance, and shall do so, till there be a <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and <hi>Protestation</hi> at its full Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions; that is, till the Witnesses shall give their <hi>Testimony;</hi> or make their <hi>Protestation</hi> on <hi>Mount Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100645:9"/>
            <p> In the last place, I will subjoyn some things by way of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary, or Inference.</p>
            <p>I begin with the first point to be secur'd, and made good, as the Foundation; <hi>viz.</hi> That this <hi>Tenth Chapter</hi> is the <hi>Visionary Table</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> which I shall undertake to settle upon these Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. The great design of the <hi>Apocalyptical prophesie,</hi> or which we style, <hi>The Revelation,</hi> is to represent the Fall of the <hi>Fourth</hi> or last of <hi>Daniels Monarchies</hi> in its two states; of the <hi>Legs of Iron;</hi> and in its state of the <hi>Feet</hi> and <hi>Toes</hi> of <hi>Iron,</hi> and of <hi>Clay;</hi> or in its state of the <hi>fourth Beast</hi> consider▪d, as in its single or simple Head; and in the <hi>Ten Hornes Rising on its Head,</hi> and a <hi>little Horn Rising among them;</hi> or if we take the thing out of the <hi>prophetical mystick Language,</hi> and give it in our vulgar way of speaking; The <hi>Apocalypse</hi> is the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Fall of the last of the <hi>four Roman Monarchies</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> in order to the Kingdom of Christ; first in its <hi>pagan Imperial state;</hi> and then in its <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian papal state,</hi> united with the <hi>Ten Kings,</hi> that gave their <hi>power</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> to the <hi>Papacy,</hi> as the <hi>universal spiritual Head</hi> of the <hi>Church on Earth;</hi> which is <hi>universal monarchy,</hi> or <hi>Empire in an Image.</hi> And this last is the principal end of <hi>prophesie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the truly universal <hi>Kingdom,</hi> being due to Jesus Christ at his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> Christ had his <hi>Churches,</hi> as <hi>witnesses</hi> against the <hi>Paganism of the Roman Empire</hi> in the first part of this <hi>prophesie;</hi> and against the <hi>Antichristianism</hi> in the latter part of it; and then the <hi>glorious Kingdom of Christ,</hi> as the last <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and complement of <hi>prophesie,</hi> or <hi>It is Done;</hi> As <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>It is Finish'd,</hi> was the complement of <hi>prophesie</hi> so far as to his Death, until his <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;</hi> As therefore the one is set at the end of the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> So the other at the end of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and indeed of all Scripture.</p>
            <p>But between these Two; the <hi>Pagan Empire,</hi> and the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Papacy;</hi> Thre is a <hi>Christian Empire,</hi> an <hi>Emblem</hi> of the last <hi>Glorious Kingdom of our God,</hi> wherein the <hi>Dragon</hi> was <hi>cast down,</hi> and the <hi>whole Beast</hi> of the <hi>Roman Idolatrous Monarchy</hi> lay <hi>wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> In the <hi>pagan part,</hi> because that was vanquish'd entirely, and to rise no more; In the <hi>Antichristian part,</hi> because the <hi>Apostle Paul</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> was this <hi>Christian Empire,</hi> that <note place="margin">2 Thess. 2.</note> prevented its coming on in the <hi>Man of sin;</hi> though but till its <hi>own Time;</hi> This <hi>Christian Empire</hi> was short; for even before It ended, It grew <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and though <hi>Antichristianism</hi> was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100645:10"/> to come on with a fuller <hi>Sail</hi> by its removal; yet in the deep Judgment of God, It was <hi>Done,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, out of the <hi>midst;</hi> both that that <hi>man of sin</hi> or <hi>Antichrist</hi> might be <hi>revealed in his own Time;</hi> as also because of the just Indignation, and abhorrence of <hi>our God;</hi> that the <hi>Emblem</hi> of his own <hi>Kingdom</hi> should be so debauch'd by that greatest opposite to his <hi>Kingdom; Antichristianism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Things I am bold to say, I have abundantly clear'd, and prov'd in other Discourses; and therefore I now presume upon them, and Any one will, I am assured acquiesce, whoever shall observe the <hi>Roman City</hi> so plainly character'd by the <hi>seven Mountains,</hi> on which <hi>It sitteth,</hi> and its having a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom over the Kings of the Earth</hi> at the Time, when the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was</hi> given; and its <hi>Three Last Kings,</hi> (for <hi>Five</hi> had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>pagan Emperor,</hi> that <hi>then was,</hi> even at the same Time of the <hi>Prophesie</hi> given; The <hi>Christian Emperor, that was not then Come,</hi> but was to <hi>Come,</hi> and not very far off, but was no <hi>Head,</hi> and was to <hi>continue</hi> but a <hi>short space,</hi> and the <hi>Eighth King,</hi> and <hi>seventh Head. viz.</hi> the <hi>Papacy,</hi> call'd the <hi>Beast,</hi> who was to succeed the <hi>Christian Emperor;</hi> and first, as Rising out of the <hi>Troubled Sea</hi> of this worlds Changes; and then to <hi>Rise out of the bottomless Pit,</hi> as his Appearance in power; and <hi>He,</hi> and his <hi>City</hi> then to go into <hi>utter perdition;</hi> and after that the State of the <hi>New Jerusalem opens</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom of Christ.</hi> Whoever, I say, shall but with glancing Thoughts observe these Things, will find the very bounds of this Great <hi>Prophesie</hi> of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to be fix'd in the <hi>King</hi> that <hi>then was,</hi> along by the <hi>short spac'd King,</hi> through the <hi>King,</hi> that hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ever since, unto his going with the <hi>City</hi> into <hi>perdition,</hi> just before the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> except that final <hi>delivery</hi> up of the <hi>Thousand years Kingdom</hi> to <hi>God and the Father,</hi> the ultimate Issue of All Things, though indeed Transcendental to this <hi>Prophesie,</hi> chiefly Aiming at that Kingdom of the <hi>Thousand years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To bring all this then home to the Argument, we are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if the <hi>Roman Antichristian Kingdom</hi> be the principal scene of <hi>Prophesie,</hi> as It is to be destroy'd before the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> and that the <hi>Reformation</hi> was such a Thunder-clap on the <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>City,</hi> that they <hi>blaspheme</hi> and rage to this day against it; and on the other side, such an Appearance, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and presence of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> as All the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> valewing it above Estate, Life, Liberty, and ready
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100645:10"/> to suffer greatest Extremities, rather then to loose it, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be; It cannot but have place in so great <hi>Prophesie</hi> so principally relating to both, the Kingdom of Christ, and to the <hi>Abolition</hi> of the <hi>Papacy</hi> in order to it.</p>
            <p>And further seeing Christ had <hi>Witnesses</hi> bearing out even to <hi>Death</hi> their <hi>Testimony</hi> against that <hi>Beastian,</hi> and <hi>Antichristian Kingdom,</hi> whose <hi>prophetical History</hi> is so particularly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly given, <hi>c.</hi> 11. If the <hi>Reformation</hi> brought some of those <hi>Witnesses</hi> out of that <hi>Death,</hi> and even as it may seem out of their very <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> Though some shall continue in both, till the end of the 1260 <hi>days.</hi> How can we possibly supppse, but that <hi>Prophesie</hi> hath given a <hi>Vision</hi> both of this Retrenchment of the <hi>Beastian Kingdom,</hi> and of such an <hi>Appearance</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> and of such a motion of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> to a <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and <hi>Ascent</hi> as the <hi>Reformation</hi> carried with it; and is therefore so <hi>providentially</hi> according to <hi>Prophesie,</hi> call'd <hi>Protestation,</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy</hi> from the publick, and open Avowment of the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> against the <hi>Papacy;</hi> So that however the occasion was particular, and the <hi>Protestation</hi> particular among the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Princes</hi> at first, yet the Appellation hath spread, God so guiding Things, upon the whole <hi>Reformation,</hi> as it were a monument of <hi>Prophesie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if when the <hi>Empire</hi> became <hi>Christian,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Beastianism,</hi> or <hi>Idolatrous Monarchy</hi> lay wounded upon it, even while <hi>Paganism</hi> was prostrate, and <hi>Antichristianism</hi> not yet rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Rise; <hi>Prophesie</hi> took such an Illustrious notice of it, as to give several <hi>Visions</hi> of it, as in the <hi>sixth Seal,</hi> in the <hi>seventh Seal,</hi> in the <hi>Grand Vision of</hi> the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and in the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>seven Heads</hi> and <hi>Eight Kings,</hi> of which the <hi>seventh</hi> was the <hi>Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi> How can we think, there could be such an Infraction upon the <hi>Beastian Kingdom,</hi> during his <hi>Forty Two Months,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in It was <hi>Given to Him to have power over all Kindreds, Tongues</hi> and <hi>Nations;</hi> That so many States, and Kingdoms, even amongst his <hi>Ten,</hi> should at the <hi>Reformation</hi> fall off from Him; while yet so many continued firm to Him, because His <hi>Forty two Months</hi> were not yet Expir'd; and that <hi>Prophesie</hi> should pass it over in silence, and give no satisfaction, This might be, and was in a peculiar Juncture of Time, wherein It might be Born, and <hi>Prophesie</hi> yet stand good, as to the <hi>Forty two Months,</hi> or <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half Time of the Beast?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100645:11"/>
            <p> I confess; The <hi>Empire</hi> becoming <hi>Christian</hi> was in many Regards a greater Event towards, and <hi>Emblem</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> in that It was an End of <hi>Paganism</hi> in the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and a change more indisputable among all, that would be call'd <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> as a most lively <hi>Idea</hi> of Christs <hi>universal Monarchy.</hi> Yet there may be found some Things wherein the <hi>Reformation</hi> Excells. But However, when there are so many <hi>Visions</hi> of the one, we may be assur'd, there is one Representation, and that to the Life too, of the other; and that therefore It may be this Great <hi>Vision</hi> of this <hi>10th</hi> Chap. if All Things agree.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. If then the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> be to be found in this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> It is certainly to be found in its due Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, place, and order with Relation to the other <hi>Visions</hi> of this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and so as to be known to be in the proper place of it; This will be easily Allowed in Honour to so <hi>divine a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,</hi> which certainly were it Fully understood, as it will be in the State of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> and more and more, the nearer we come to it, will appear a mirrour of <hi>Infinite understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> in the most exact mixture of <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Shades,</hi> Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and yet concealing, that Things could receive, or the minds of <hi>Angels,</hi> and of <hi>Men</hi> be presented with, as we may easily apprehend, by what every Eye may with wonder and Astonishment behold in it. Among which are the highest points of Truth for the Glory of <hi>Immense wisdom, Justice</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> and for the Happiness and Exaltation of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Saints,</hi> and profoundest <hi>Judgment</hi> on his <hi>Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the order of the <hi>Visions</hi> of this <hi>Prophecy</hi> is not so much in the Contexture of the parts, as they lye in Chapters, but in the Adjustment of each <hi>Vision</hi> from Chap. 5. to the end, to those great <hi>Aque-ducts</hi> or <hi>Conduits</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> the <hi>Seven Seals,</hi> the <hi>Seven Trumpets,</hi> and the <hi>Seven Thunders</hi> opened and <hi>unseal'd</hi> in <hi>Voices,</hi> and the <hi>Seven Vials.</hi> Each of which setts of <hi>Tubes,</hi> or <hi>Apocalyptical Pipes;</hi> and each single <hi>Tube</hi> or <hi>Pipe</hi> is to be joyn'd to the precedent <hi>Tube</hi> or <hi>Pipe,</hi> as at their full length, Reaching from one end of the <hi>Prophecy</hi> and of its <hi>Times</hi> to the other; So that from the first <hi>Seal</hi> to the last <hi>Vial pour'd</hi> out, the <hi>Prophecy</hi> extends till the <hi>Thousand years</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ, as its utmost reach; the <hi>Kingdom deliver'd up to God,</hi> and <hi>the Fathers,</hi> at the <hi>white Throne</hi> being briefly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd; Except only, that the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> is Concorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the <hi>Thunders</hi> and <hi>Vials,</hi> so that the <hi>Seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100645:11"/> Issues wholly into them, and the <hi>Seven Thunders</hi> or <hi>Voices,</hi> and the <hi>Seven Vials</hi> are the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> discharging it self; All which may be demonstratively made out either in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressive, or Retrograde motion, were it not too large for this purpose, and is in readiness to offer to any considerer, that shall desire it.</p>
            <p>But though these <hi>prophetical</hi> Conveyances are the True Rule of the order of the <hi>Visions,</hi> yet very often the Contexture of the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as it lies in Chapters, gives the true order also, which being Tryed by that sure Rule of those Conduitss of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and found to be so, is to be own'd, and acknowledg'd as so, and here it is so. For the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> stands in its just place, and Time, within the <hi>Sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi> and in the <hi>Tenth Chapter.</hi> For this <hi>Tenth Chapter</hi> lies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Sixth Trumpet</hi> or <hi>Second woe-Trumpet</hi> beginning to <hi>sound, c.</hi> 9. 1. 12. and being <hi>pass'd c.</hi> 11. 4.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>sixth Trumpet</hi> is the Judgment of the <hi>Turkish Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany</hi> upon the whole <hi>Anthristian</hi> World, but especially, as it seiz'd upon the <hi>Graecian Empire,</hi> and its <hi>Imperial City, Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> Call'd also <hi>New Rome;</hi> and the <hi>Empire,</hi> the <hi>Eastern Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire,</hi> Become, when the whole <hi>Roman Empire</hi> grew <hi>Antichristian,</hi> by the division of it into <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> as the other <hi>Iron Leg</hi> in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s <hi>Idolatrous Image;</hi> and to the same purpose recorded in this <hi>Prophecy</hi> as <hi>Two Wings of the Great Eagle,</hi> carrying by its <hi>Antichristianizing</hi> the True <hi>Church of Christ</hi> into the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> as into a Lost, Hidden, out of sight Condition; that it might well be ask'd, where was it? For the <hi>Apostasie</hi> had <hi>Ecclips▪d</hi> and close muffled it, even from the <hi>Eye of the Serpent</hi> c. 12.</p>

            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:100645:12"/>
            <p> Thus Demonstrative is the order of the <hi>Turkish Woe</hi> in the <hi>Sixth Trumpet,</hi> into which the <hi>Reformation</hi> is Enchas'd upon so great Evidence of matter of Fact, and on so great Reason.</p>
            <p>The Evidence of Fact is, That within about Sixty Four years, after <hi>Constantinople</hi> that <hi>Imperial City of Greece</hi> became the <hi>Ottoman Port, viz.</hi> 1453. The <hi>Reformation</hi> dawn'd, <hi>viz.</hi> 1517. The Time between was no longer, then that the Impenitency of <hi>Western Rome</hi> in all its <hi>Idolatry, Murthers, Blood, Sorceries,</hi> and <hi>Thefts</hi> could give the Experiments of it self; as the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> observes, Cap. 9. the last.</p>
            <p>And with this particular Remarque, The very occasion of the <hi>Reformation</hi> Taken, was detecting the <hi>Thefts</hi> of <hi>Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> as <hi>Prophecy</hi> calls them, by <hi>Luther</hi>'s Preaching against them, at that Time Expos'd to Sale, to raise a <hi>Fond</hi> for the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish War,</hi> as if <hi>Providence</hi> Lin'd out Events, and chain'd them exactly according to <hi>Prophecy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so the <hi>Turkish woe,</hi> and the <hi>Reformation</hi> have continued together ever since waiting the great change of Things at the end of this <hi>Sixth Trumpet;</hi> This is matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>Now the Evidence of Reason, and Argument, that the <hi>Turkish Woe</hi> should be so soon followed by the <hi>Reformation,</hi> is;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Turkish Empire</hi> placing it self so in the <hi>Imperial</hi> Seat, and Territories of <hi>Greece</hi> did seem exceedingly Dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative to the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> and to the Acquist it had madc upon the <hi>Pagan Empire,</hi> when in Symblols of Christ's <hi>Ʋniversal Monarchy,</hi> as it were own'd, and Ratified in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, The <hi>Manly Birth</hi> was <hi>caught up to the Throne of God,</hi> and as a Counterpart of it, the <hi>Name of Christ</hi> was to be for ever after the Supreme <hi>Imperial</hi> name in the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> though it be the most close, and <hi>Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical</hi> Enemy of all others to the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> yet it is by way of <hi>Ecclips,</hi> Surprize and Stealth of the Glory of Christ, which it pretends to Advance; and is therefore Figur'd most Elegantly by the <hi>Moon under the Churches Feet,</hi> stealing the Rays of the <hi>Sun</hi> with which the True <hi>Christian Church</hi> is <hi>cloath'd</hi> and Investing the false <hi>Antichristian Church</hi> with them; So that it self is not seen in Glory, but still the Glory is <hi>Christian,</hi> even as <hi>Christian</hi> is Roll'd up in <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> Furl'd up in <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the <hi>Turkish Empire,</hi> however it make some Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latteral Acknowledgment of Christ, yet it Advances the <hi>False</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:100645:13"/>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> above Him; and that openly, and Avowedly, and displays its Banners in his Name; And to do this in <hi>New Rome</hi> look▪d like an Infringment upon the <hi>manly Birth caught up to the Throne of God.</hi> Because indeed <hi>Mahometism</hi> is <hi>Infidelism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this even <hi>Antichristianism</hi> hath been always so sensible, and of its own concern in it, pretending to an <hi>Ʋniversal Kingdom</hi> as <hi>Vicarious</hi> to Christ, That as It hath from the first Rising of that <hi>Paraselene,</hi> or <hi>Mock-moon</hi> to it self made all service against these <hi>Infidels,</hi> as for the Honour of Christ, highly <hi>meritorious;</hi> as appears by all the History of <hi>Indulgences, Croisades, Orders of Knighthood,</hi> and other Titles of Glory given by the <hi>Popish See</hi> on that Account of War against <hi>Mahomet;</hi> whence, as <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> speaks, The <hi>Earth helpt the Woman</hi> against these professed <hi>Infidels,</hi> though They call Themselves <hi>Believers;</hi> And They are indeed a sort of <hi>Mock-believers</hi> to the <hi>Antichristian Believers</hi> in the Esteem of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then to vindicate this Appearance, Christ is pleas'd to make that Sally of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> presented in the <hi>Reformation</hi> at no Time so seasonable, as when a Name so openly, and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly an Enemy to Christ had possess'd one of <hi>Romes Imperial Names;</hi> For hereby Christ remonstrated, that his True <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> was not that which was open in <hi>Rome</hi> and its <hi>Ten Kingdoms</hi> about it, but <hi>Hidden;</hi> that He had <hi>a Church in the Wilderness,</hi> and <hi>witnesses in Sackcloath,</hi> who were indeed his <hi>Kingdom</hi> in the World, and that <hi>Rome</hi> and its <hi>Supremacy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as in a <hi>Spiritual Ʋniversal Mornarchy,</hi> The <hi>Ten Kings</hi> were united, was the same <hi>Beastian Fourth Monarchy,</hi> that the <hi>Pagan</hi> had been before it; and that the <hi>Turkish Woe</hi> upon it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that very <hi>Kingdom,,</hi> that was to be <hi>destroyed before his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and that <hi>City, Rome,</hi> that was to be <hi>Burnt as a Sodom from Heaven;</hi> of which the <hi>Turkish Woe</hi> was some pledge tho' afar off.</p>
            <p>Yet partly for the sake of Christs Imperial Name Roll'd up in <hi>Antichrist</hi>'s <hi>Name,</hi> and partly for the Time allowed to the <hi>Beasts Kingdom;</hi> That <hi>Piercing Turkish Leviathan</hi> could never nor ever shall Reach the <hi>Western Roman Empire or City,</hi> but is placed in an out-lying <hi>Imperialism,</hi> that <hi>Rome Antichristian,</hi> always Challeng'd an <hi>Empire</hi> over, as one of its <hi>Horns:</hi> But as a Pawn, and Pledge, and Earnest of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> It pleas'd the Supreme <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords</hi> to bring some of his <hi>Witnesses</hi> out of <hi>Sackcloth</hi> into an open <hi>Witness,</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation</hi> with <hi>Authority;</hi> and so a part of his <hi>Church</hi> out of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100645:13"/>
               <hi>Wilderness</hi> to appear visible in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> so immediately after the <hi>Turkish Sultany</hi> fix'd in the <hi>Eastern Rome;</hi> as it were by way of Reprizal from <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>West,</hi> so much of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which by the <hi>Reformation</hi> should become real to Him there, as upon the Account of <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> and in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, He had given up in the <hi>East,</hi> as a <hi>Port</hi> to <hi>Mahomet;</hi> an Enemy Acknowledg'd his Enemy by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Subjects of the <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> though indeed his most <hi>Diametrical</hi> Enemies themselves; to convince and move them to Repentance.</p>
            <p>For that both the <hi>Eastern,</hi> and <hi>Western Antichristian Empire</hi> was, as All one Body of men, in the same Condemnation of <hi>Idolatries, Murthers, Thefts, Sorceries,</hi> It is <hi>witness▪d;</hi> In that it is said, notwithstanding the Judgment of God on the <hi>Eastern Empire</hi> for these Sins; The <hi>Rest of men, viz.</hi> of the <hi>Western Empire Repented</hi> not; So the <hi>Reformation</hi> was a Remonstrance from God, and Christ, the <hi>Antichristian Empire</hi> of neither <hi>East</hi> nor <hi>West</hi> was his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> but a <hi>Church,</hi> He brought out of the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> and her <hi>Seed</hi> out of <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> that lay hid in that <hi>Western Beastian Kingdom,</hi> were so brought out, as a small, and Imperfect Map of his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> And this Remonstrance was then seasonably given after the <hi>Eastern Empire</hi> so seiz'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Reformation</hi> was thus Scituated in the <hi>sixth Trumpet, and Second woe,</hi> Continuing till the <hi>seventh Trumpet;</hi> that it might be known, that even the <hi>Reformation</hi> it self was but a dark, and Imperfect Table of <hi>Christs Kingdom;</hi> For so Great a <hi>Kingdom</hi> as Christs, cannot bear such an usurpation, as the <hi>Mahometan Imposture</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> to have Invaded that, which was once the Residence of his <hi>Imperial Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that while the <hi>Popish Supremacy</hi> calls it self the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and damns the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as <hi>Heresie;</hi> and while the <hi>Reformation</hi> knows it self, if it does aright understand it self, a first breaking out of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> Yet by the so universally Acknowledg'd enemy of the <hi>Christian Name,</hi> as the <hi>Mahometan Signiory</hi> upon so Eminent a Mountain, as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople;</hi> There might be Assurance to the <hi>Antichristian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> It cannot be the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> but that it <hi>Ecclipses</hi> it; and to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> that is was, and is but as the first Essay to the <hi>Kingdom of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100645:14"/>
            <p> And thus by the Infinite wisdom of the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> the whole Time of the <hi>Reformation</hi> was Inlay'd with the <hi>sixth Trumpet,</hi> after the Great Execution of it upon the <hi>Eastern Empire;</hi> And its <hi>Woe</hi> still continued as a <hi>Woe,</hi> but by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable decree so stopp'd, that it could notwithstanding all its Attempts never extend it self to <hi>Rome,</hi> to Fix there; nor so much as to possess it self of that so called <hi>Imperial City</hi> of <hi>Vienna;</hi> But its <hi>Proud Waves</hi> are ebbing Back now, so as by the end of the <hi>sixth Trumpet</hi> to return to their <hi>Original Euphrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus on one side, the <hi>Reformation</hi> appear'd soon after the Seizure of the <hi>Greek Empire,</hi> to shew, Christ was not unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> Though He suffer'd that part of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> proper to Him during the <hi>Beastian Kingdom</hi> to be usurp'd, not immediately from Himself, but from the first usurper, the <hi>Beastian Kingdom,</hi> as a Brand upon its first usurpation from the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> And to shew, that although it is not the Time of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> yet that He is mindful of it; He therefore gave that Earnest, and beginning of it in the <hi>Reformation:</hi> But on the other side, the <hi>Woe</hi> continues after the <hi>Reformation,</hi> to shew; Even the <hi>Reformation</hi> is but a very dark <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> that besides the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in it self, He suffers not onely such a Continuance of the Counterfeit Christ, the <hi>Papacy,</hi> but that more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd enemy of his Name <hi>Mahometanism;</hi> Two such to one another, as well as to his own <hi>Kingdom</hi> Counter usurpations; and both of them such, that while either continues, his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> cannot <hi>Come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The <hi>Vision</hi> we have before us, must be by all the Figures of it, a <hi>Vision</hi> of very Great significancy, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; It must stand in its due order, and Scituation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the seizure of the <hi>Eastern Empire;</hi> Let then any one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce out of all <hi>History</hi> an Event of such Lustre, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, as that of the <hi>Reformatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> that may Answer this <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> and the <hi>Types</hi> of it, as in the next place are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented; and at the Time, that is also to be demonstrated to be the Time of this <hi>Vision;</hi> In both which, It is to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prov'd, that this <hi>Vision</hi> can be no other, then the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> So that if there be no <hi>Types</hi> in this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> that can so exactly, as these, Answer the Revolution of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> or at all in its due order, and Time, (which as hath been prov'd, must have such a <hi>Vision</hi> somewhere
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100645:14"/> in this <hi>Prophecy)</hi> And on the other side if there be no event) in <hi>History,</hi> that can in that order, and that Time be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to answer these <hi>Types;</hi> we have all the security that can be given in a <hi>Mysticall Prophecy,</hi> that this <hi>Vision,</hi> and the <hi>Reformation</hi> do most certainly Answer, and Indent, the one with the other.</p>
            <p>That which alone can be pretended to Answer one side of this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Reformation</hi> not having any other place, then of this <hi>Vision</hi> in this <hi>Prophecy</hi> is; That the <hi>Vision of the Reformation</hi> is Included in the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses,</hi> as the proper place of it; the <hi>Reformation</hi> being a beginning <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> and the compleat <hi>Resurrection</hi> being at the end of the 1260 days; and so that <hi>Reformation,</hi> which is Acknowledg'd worthy to be Honour'd with a <hi>Vision,</hi> and to have a place in this <hi>Prophecy</hi> shall find it, and that in the most proper place, <hi>viz.</hi> as a part in the whole, that is, this partial <hi>Resurrection</hi> in the Plenary <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides, that this Supposition leaves the other side of the Argument; <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no event in due order, and Time to be found in <hi>History,</hi> that may answer the <hi>Vis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on</hi> of Chap. 10. It is also unsatisfactory in this Regard; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Reformation</hi> is of such peculiar nature, and at such a peculiar Time; That it must have a <hi>Vision,</hi> as peculiar to it; (though it be also Included in that of the <hi>witnesses Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection)</hi> and no less could satisfie it, as shall be further made good in the <hi>Types</hi> of the Time; wherein also any seeming objection from part of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and of their <hi>History</hi> being given before the whole, shall be not only answer'd, but be shown to be Enforcive of the main point; That this <hi>Vision</hi> is the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> both (as hath been said) from the <hi>Types,</hi> and from the Time of the <hi>Vision.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come therefore to the second point, <hi>viz.</hi> To consider the <hi>Types</hi> of this <hi>Vision,</hi> which are to be distributed into two kinds.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Those which are proper to the breaking out and to the appearance of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Those which are prepar'd to signifie the <hi>Estoppage</hi> of that <hi>Kingdom;</hi> That it should not <hi>Appear in Glory</hi> according to the Hopes at first given.</item>
            </list>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100645:15"/>
            <p> There is also another peculiar <hi>Type,</hi> proper to neither sort, but mediating between both, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Time;</hi> But that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the Third point, to which I deferr it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I Begin with the first sort of <hi>Types, viz.</hi> Those, which are proper to the <hi>opening,</hi> and <hi>Appearance</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> And they are those, which we find in the very <hi>Vision, viz. A Mighty Angel coming down from Heaven,</hi> appearing as to <hi>Daniel</hi> of old, as an <hi>Angel;</hi> though it was Indeed <hi>Christ the Lord of Angels;</hi> who in regard of the greatness of his work is said to make a descent from Heaven; which is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the General manner of Scripture speaking, when God does any great thing in the World; He <hi>Bows,</hi> and <hi>rends the Heavens,</hi> and <hi>comes down.</hi> And such expressions are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to <hi>Scripture Eloquence;</hi> But they have all some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>Prophetical</hi> also of that great <hi>Opening,</hi> and <hi>Bowing the Heavens,</hi> that shall be at the <hi>Kingdom of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is with all greatly Conducing to the present purpose, to observe, that the <hi>Types</hi> of this <hi>Vision</hi> are with great Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siveness to the <hi>vision of Daniel, c.</hi> 10. and especially <hi>c.</hi> 12. even as the <hi>Visions</hi> are closely Allyed, and in some things even united: The <hi>Angel</hi> here is <hi>Cloathed with a Cloud,</hi> a Bright, white <hi>Cloud,</hi> as it were parallel to the <hi>Linnen</hi> in <hi>Daniel:</hi> He had a <hi>Rain-bow</hi> on his <hi>Head,</hi> the great <hi>Symbol</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> from the <hi>days of Noah</hi> into the very <hi>Appearance</hi> of it in the <hi>New Jerusalem;</hi> and therefore was also <hi>Round about</hi> the <hi>Throne</hi> in <hi>Ezek. c.</hi> 1. and in this <hi>Prophecy, c.</hi> 4. and does Admirably Represent the Glory of the <hi>Divinity</hi> as the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Lights</hi> reflected by the <hi>Humanity</hi> in that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ,</hi> as it were distinct, and at a distance, and as obverted to the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Divine nature;</hi> and so making a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> distinct, and as it were separate for the 1000 <hi>Years,</hi> until it be again <hi>delivered up to God and the Father,</hi> and the <hi>Divinity</hi> be <hi>All in All</hi> as in the <hi>Kingdom of Eternity.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Face of Christ,</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> was, as the <hi>Sun</hi> even as the <hi>Lightning</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Lamps</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> sending out the Rays, from which the <hi>Rain-bow</hi> sprang upon the <hi>Humanity,</hi> as it were the <hi>Cloud,</hi> with which He was <hi>Cover'd,</hi> Beautified with all the Colours of the <hi>Rain-bow,</hi> or as the Beryll; His <hi>Feet</hi> were as <hi>Pillars</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> or <hi>Pollish'd Brass, Burning</hi> in a <hi>Furnace;</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying an Irresistible power, with which He <hi>Tramples the Nations of his Enemies,</hi> and <hi>Treads</hi> them in <hi>Fury,</hi> while His

               </gap>o the <hi>Lyon of the Tribe of Judah</hi> in token of his dread Majesty and Supreme power, <hi>Cryed with a Loud voice,</hi> and <hi>Seven Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> as Issuing out of the <hi>Roar</hi> of the <hi>Lyon uttered their Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> And as when Christ went out on his <hi>white Horse, c.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Conquering</hi> and to <hi>Conquer,</hi> in the <hi>First Seal,</hi> The <hi>Voice, come and see</hi> was as of <hi>Thunder;</hi> so all along the <hi>Prophecy</hi> So here <hi>seven Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> now all these are evidently <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as it were over against these, are the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of Christ, stay'd or <hi>Estopp'd</hi> in this its Appearance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first of which is <hi>John</hi>'s being Commanded to <hi>Not Write,</hi> but to <hi>Seal</hi> the <hi>Ʋtterances</hi> of the <hi>Thunders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>writing,</hi> and <hi>sealing</hi> are oppos'd in this <hi>Prophecy</hi> as Delay, and immediately Coming to pass are oppos'd: The <hi>seal</hi> on the <hi>Foreheads</hi> of the 144000. was a Reserve of their Glory to a Future Time, or after the 1260 <hi>days;</hi> The <hi>writing the Fathers Name</hi> on their <hi>Foreheads</hi> was for a present appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the <hi>Lamb</hi> on <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> in order to Glory, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the 1260 <hi>days</hi> ended; Thus it is said to <hi>John,</hi> as at the Time of the <hi>Vials;</hi> For the Angel of the <hi>Vials</hi> was then with, <note place="margin">Revel. 22. 10.</note> and by him; <hi>Seal not the sayings of this Book,</hi> for <hi>the Time is at Hand.</hi> Seeing then the <hi>Thunders</hi> were great Promulgations in order to the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> the <hi>fealing</hi> and <hi>not writing</hi> was a certain <hi>Estopple</hi> put to the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> that it should not then <hi>Appear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Command upon <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Eat</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> that was <hi>held open</hi> in the <hi>Hand of the Angel,</hi> is a very plain <hi>Symbol</hi> of the Retyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and so a stop of it: For the <hi>opening the Book,</hi> and <hi>Loosing the seven seals</hi> was <hi>opening</hi> to the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when <hi>Paganism</hi> was desolated by the <hi>sixth seal open'd;</hi> the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>

               <hi>of our God</hi> gave an Ombrage of it self, within the <hi>seventh seal;</hi> But then for the stay of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> The 144000, of the same Import, and at the same Time with the <hi>Witnesses</hi> in <hi>Sackcloath,</hi>

            <p>What is more <hi>Bitter</hi> to the Servants of Christ, in whom the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Bride say, come,</hi> then the <hi>delay</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> and yet what more <hi>sweet</hi> then the Publications of it, as certainly to come?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Prophecying again</hi> is the last <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> under <hi>Estoppage:</hi> For that <hi>Kingdom</hi> being the utmost <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the <hi>It is Finished</hi> of all <hi>Prophecy; Prophecy</hi> must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, till that <hi>Kingdom come;</hi> Then, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> says, It <hi>Fails,</hi> or ceases; For the <hi>Prophecy</hi> is of things to come; But when they are come, to what end is <hi>Prophecy</hi> any longer? To say therefore, <hi>John</hi> is to <hi>Prophesie again,</hi> is to say, the Time was not yet come for the last <hi>Finishing</hi> of the <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> which God had <hi>declared by all his Servants the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then look on the <hi>Reformation</hi> in its undoubted Matter of fact and we must needs allow, it was a <hi>Revolution of wonder,</hi> at least as of a pre-appearance, or pledge of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> it self; There had been indeed Motions towards it a far off, like those, we call Farly <hi>Thunders</hi> by the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> and <hi>Waldenses,</hi> but they were by the <hi>Papal power</hi> destroyed with prodigious slaughters, and so the <hi>Witnesses deeper in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth;</hi> There were the Attempts of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> nearer Hand: But these with some others however Remarkable in themselves could not (the Time appointed by God being not yet come) sustain themselves in a certain Train, and <hi>Series</hi> to that settled state, we call the <hi>Reformation,</hi> whatever preparations they might be to it.</p>
            <p>But when that Time was Come, though the <hi>Papacy</hi> Sat like the <hi>Strong man Armed</hi> in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> with its <hi>Ten Kings</hi> about it, and its <hi>Goods, dominion</hi> over <hi>Consciences, Infallibility,</hi> Subjection to <hi>Idolatrous decrees, Superstitions, Canons, Indulgences, Pardons, vast</hi>

               </note> a <hi>Marked Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> single, and Inconsiderable to that Purpose, Preaching against <hi>Indulgences;</hi> There was such a <hi>Roar,</hi> or <hi>Cry of the Lyon,</hi> that so many Princes, and States, as we know, one after another Aroused Themselves, and vindicated their <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> from the <hi>Beast,</hi> and their Consciences from the <hi>Sorceries</hi> of that <hi>Apostate Church,</hi> to whom for so many Ages They had given them; and so far Chang'd the Face of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> and <hi>Western World,</hi> as since then hath been seen; And if Things had Gon on, as They began, <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ</hi> had long since Appeard.</p>
            <p>But we must Acknowledge, Least we <hi>be wise in our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,</hi> and we know it by sad Experienc; that according to the <hi>Schems of Prophecy,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> that gave such an Appearance, and that as It pleases, <hi>works its signs,</hi> and <hi>Wonders in Heaven and Earth,</hi> in what a sudden, and by what Inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable means It pleaseth, and None can <hi>Stay</hi> it, but it self, was staid; We must not Therefore Think of the <hi>Protestant Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es above what we ought</hi> to <hi>Think,</hi> and <hi>above what is written</hi> and so be Prejudic'd against a <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a much Higher <hi>Appearance</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> that is so near us; We have not, however we Talk of the best <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches in the World, Seald</hi> up the <hi>Sum of Beauty,</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> in our <hi>Christian Wisdom;</hi> we have not been in <hi>Eden</hi> the <note place="margin">Ezek. 28. 13.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Whoever then shall Attend to the <hi>Types</hi> of this <hi>Vision,</hi> and to both sides of Things in the <hi>Reformation, viz</hi> as It is a pledge and Pre-Appearance of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and yet stay'd and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stop'd, will Find, that Both Agree; And that the <hi>Types</hi> of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100645:17"/>
               <hi>Vision</hi> are <hi>Types of the Kingdom of Christ,</hi> not as It should then Appear, but as It shall Appear at the Last: For if The <hi>Types</hi> had been Absolutely of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as then <hi>Appearing,</hi> There had been no <hi>Estoppage.</hi> So the <hi>Reformation</hi> was not the <hi>Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> it self, but a <hi>Pre-Appearance:</hi> The <hi>Kingdom</hi> therefore is not to be measur'd by the <hi>Reformation,</hi> because There was a Stop put; Nor can the <hi>Reformation</hi> be measur'd by the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> it self, or Single, and by themselves Alone; For so They are much too High, and too Great; But It is to be measur'd by the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and by the <hi>Types of the Estoppage</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> together; It is therefore no Argument The <hi>Vision</hi> is not the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> by themselves are much too Large for what the <hi>Reformation</hi> hath yet prov'd; But It is to be Consider'd There are <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Estoppage</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> it self, and Both are to be Equally Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the <hi>Reformation;</hi> And then we shall, when we come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Compare the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> and of the <hi>Estoppage,</hi> and of the State of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> Respectivly Each to other, in a more Discursive, Applicatory Review, Find how Exact One is to the other.</p>
            <p>For in the very same manner, the <hi>Christian Empire, Revil.</hi> 12. 10. was Given in <hi>Vision,</hi> as the very <hi>Glorious Kingdom of Christ; Now is Come Salvation,</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of Our God.</hi> One would hence Think, It was the <hi>Kingdom of our God</hi> it self. But even that <hi>Christian Empire</hi> was far too Low, and much too short for those <hi>Types;</hi> and so much more for the <hi>Kingdom it self;</hi> we must therefore Attend to the other <hi>Types</hi> Given with it; <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>Churches Flight</hi> into the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> to the <hi>Devil Coming down with Great Wrath;</hi> to the <hi>Dra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons Persecuting</hi> the <hi>Woman</hi> the True <hi>Church</hi> and her <hi>Flight</hi> again Repeated; and then Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a <hi>Flood after Her,</hi> and when He Could not overtake her, then <hi>making war by the Beast with her Seed, Keeping the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God,</hi> and <hi>Holding the Testimony of Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now none of These Things could Agree with the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> it self; The <hi>Types</hi> therefore Taken together shew, the <hi>Christian Empire</hi> was only a <hi>Fore-Runner,</hi> a Pledge, an <hi>Emblem</hi> of That <hi>Kingdom,</hi> however Great It was, and not the <hi>Kingdom</hi> it self. And so Proportinably the double <hi>Types</hi> Teach us to Esteem of the <hi>Reformation</hi> as a <hi>Pre-Appearance</hi> a <hi>Precursion,</hi> and Pledge, and not the <hi>Kingdom</hi> it self; And so the <hi>Vision</hi> and the <hi>Reformation</hi> will to Admiration Concert.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100645:17"/>
            <p> I Come then to the Third <hi>Point</hi> of this Discourse; <hi>viz.</hi> To <note place="margin">Point 3.</note> demonstrate the Time of this <hi>Vision,</hi> or the definition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Time; when this <hi>Vision</hi> was first to Take place; and how long It is to Continue in Date; or when the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> Appearing in it, first made that Appearance, and then was Estop'd; and how Long It will Continue under that <hi>Estoppage,</hi> till all Things shall be in Motion for the <hi>Finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>Mystery,</hi> or the very Full <hi>Appearance</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> it self: Which truely Explain'd will make according to this <hi>Prophecy</hi> a farther, and most Undeniable Argument, This <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Resolution of this Point is to be Found in that most peculiar <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Angels lifting up his Right-Hand to Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Swearing by Him,</hi> that <hi>made Heaven,</hi> and <hi>all Things that therein are</hi> (So Solemn is this Oath) <hi>and the Earth,</hi> and <hi>All Things, that therein are;</hi> and <hi>the Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Things that therein are; That there should be Time no Longer,</hi> but that in <hi>the days of the Seventh Angell, when He shall Begin to Sound,</hi> The <hi>Mistery of God shall be Finish'd,</hi> as He hath <hi>Gospelliz'd</hi> by his <hi>Servants the Prophets;</hi> which <hi>Type</hi> as I have said mediates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Two sorts of <hi>Types, viz.</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom Appearing,</hi> and of the <hi>Kingdom Estop'd;</hi> and defines the Time both of the <hi>Appearance,</hi> and of the <hi>Estoppage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now of this Great <hi>Type</hi> or this most <hi>Sollemn Oath,</hi> I Affirm these three Things as drawn from it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this <hi>Oath</hi> must be definitive of a certain Time when this <hi>Vision</hi> was to Take place, and when to End.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That That <hi>Time</hi> is such, as must most necessarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this <hi>Vision</hi> Compar'd with the whole <hi>Prophecy</hi> be the Time of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and Can be no Other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That that Time so demonstrated must determine this Time, when the <hi>Reformation</hi> shall be no Longer in so Low a State, but when the <hi>Reformation,</hi> it self shall be <hi>Reform'd</hi> by the Action under the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> Hastening All Things to the <hi>Finishing of the Mistery,</hi> or to the <hi>Appearance</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ in Glory:</hi> For at that <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> The <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> shall be in its Succession, but not immediatly <hi>Appear in Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Affirm,</hi> 1. This <hi>Oath,</hi> must be definitive of the certain Times, When This <hi>Vision</hi> was to Take Place; For the make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of which, I will proceed by these Three Gradations of Argument.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100645:18"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument,</hi> 1, The <hi>Oath,</hi> and the <hi>Vision</hi> are so Enfolded, United, and Combind, that if the Time of the <hi>Oath</hi> Taking Place Can be defin'd by the <hi>Oath</hi> it self, The Time of the <hi>Visions</hi> Taking Place, may also be defined by the Time of the <hi>Oaths</hi> Taking Place; because they are so United, that they must Take Place together.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Oath</hi> we Find so Carv'd, and Engraven into the <hi>Vision</hi> it self, that They can in nothing be Separated the one from the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vision</hi> Evidently Began in the <hi>Mighty Angels Coming down from Heaven,</hi> That <hi>Angel Stands upon the Sea, and the Earth;</hi> That <hi>Angel</hi> that stood upon the <hi>Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Earth Lifts up his Hand</hi> to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Swears</hi> this <hi>Oath</hi> at the same Time: Thus what ever Pertain'd to the description of the <hi>Angel,</hi> Pertain'd also to the <hi>Oath</hi> by vertue of the <hi>Angel Swearing</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Again this <hi>Angel</hi> had a <hi>Little Book open in his Hand,</hi> and <hi>Cry'd</hi> as a <hi>Lion Roaring:</hi> Upon his <hi>Cry,</hi> either as Issuing out of it, or as Attendant upon it <hi>Seven Thunders Ʋttered their Voices; John</hi> is Commanded by a <hi>Voice from Heaven to Not write,</hi> but to <hi>Seal the Thunders Ʋtterances.</hi> The same <hi>Voice,</hi> that Bid him <hi>not write</hi> but <hi>Seale, spake to Him again,</hi> and Commanded Him to <hi>Take</hi> that <hi>Book,</hi> which was <hi>Open</hi> in the <hi>Hand</hi> of that very <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi> that <hi>Stood upon the Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Eat</hi> it; and the <hi>Angel</hi> Told Him, It would be <hi>sweet in the Mouth,</hi> and <hi>Bitter</hi> in the <hi>Belly,</hi> and Commissioned him to <hi>Prophesie again.</hi> So the <hi>Angel,</hi> and <hi>Voice from Heaven</hi> Enfolded thus in the <hi>Vision,</hi> Enfold the <hi>Vision,</hi> and All parts of it one with Another; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Loosing the Harmony and Tone of the whole <hi>Vision,</hi> None can be Separated: The design of one, is the design of all. The Time of one is the Time of All. And for this End and as on purpose, <hi>Prophesie</hi> is most Careful, to tell us, The <hi>Angel</hi> is the same, and Concern'd in every pointof the <hi>Vision;</hi> and the <hi>Voice from Heaven</hi> the same, Running throughout it also: Twice the <hi>Angel</hi> is Assur'd to be the <hi>Same,</hi> that <hi>stood on the Sea and the Earth:</hi> Twice the <hi>Voice</hi> is said to be <hi>from Heaven,</hi> and to be the same the Second Time, that spoke to <hi>John</hi> the First: and Both so Entwin'd with all parts of the <hi>Vision,</hi> as no way to be parted; and therefore the <hi>Vision</hi> and the <hi>Oath,</hi> a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Act of the <hi>Angel</hi> and a Principal part of the <hi>Vision</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be parted from one Another; For an <hi>Oath</hi> is a Principal Act, and must be so in Him, that <hi>Swears,</hi> and must be so
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100645:18"/> in the <hi>Vision,</hi> that Represents it. Thus all Things relating to Each must Go together, and therefore Particularly the Time of the one Taking place must be the Time of the other Taking place; that is within the due order of the <hi>Vision.</hi>

The <hi>Oath,</hi> and the <hi>Vision</hi> and the several parts of the <hi>Vision</hi> Taking Place together, as so united, as hath been already Shown; Each <hi>Type</hi> of Each sort <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom Appearing,</hi> and of the <hi>Kingdom Estop'd</hi> must Take their Places within the Bounds of the <hi>Vision</hi> according to the <hi>Oath;</hi> So that the <hi>Angel</hi> might so Appear first in the Proper Time of the <hi>Vision</hi> with his <hi>Face</hi> as the <hi>Sun,</hi> Holding the <hi>Book of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom open;</hi> He might then <hi>Cry</hi> as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and <hi>Seven Thunders Ʋtter their Voices.</hi> And then the <hi>Thunders</hi> must be <hi>Seald,</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> must be <hi>Clos'd;</hi> And all must Retreat again into <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,</hi> and this according to the Time, that the <hi>Oath</hi> shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us to, in the very Proper Time of the <hi>Vision.</hi> And the <hi>Oath</hi> is a <hi>Vision</hi> Relating to <hi>Time;</hi> For the Thing <hi>Sworn</hi> is; <hi>Time shall be no more,</hi> but in the <hi>days</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Angel,</hi> when He shall <hi>Begin to Sound, The Mistery of God shall be Finished;</hi> So then the Bounds of the Time of the <hi>Vision</hi> and of the <hi>Oath</hi> are from the Time, In which It could Truely be <hi>Sworn, Time shall be no more,</hi> till the <hi>days of the Seventh Angel</hi> and his <hi>Beginning to Sound.</hi> For then the <hi>Visions</hi> of <hi>Estoppage</hi> Cease and All is <hi>Finishing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And seeing an <hi>Oath</hi> and an <hi>Oath of Christ,</hi> that must Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be <hi>an End of all Strife</hi> Cannot be Suppos'd to Give an <hi>Incertain Sound;</hi> There is Certainly then by Assur'd, however Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Characters Some Key to be Found, by which the <hi>Time,</hi> when this <hi>Oath</hi> and so this <hi>Vision</hi> might according to it Take Place, and when It is to End, or Issue into the <hi>Seventh Trumpet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. That we may Find this determinate Time of the <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Vision,</hi> we can have no <hi>Key,</hi> but the <hi>Key</hi> of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and because, we are upon <hi>Prophetical Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Key</hi> must be Found in <hi>Prophetical Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in dealing with <hi>Scripture,</hi> we know, It is a Great and Necessary duty to Compare <hi>Scripture</hi> with <hi>Scripture,</hi> and so <hi>Prophetical Scripture</hi> with <hi>Prophetical Scripture,</hi> when we are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Prophesie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No One then, that Considers this <hi>Oath,</hi> and hath Read, and Remembers that <hi>Oath,</hi> or will be but Guided by the <hi>Margin</hi> of his <hi>Bible,</hi> to <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 7. and minds to Compare <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turo</hi> with <hi>Scripture</hi> Can Choose, but Compare the <hi>Oath</hi> there
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100645:19"/> and the <hi>Oath</hi> here, to see how far they Agree; And first He will Find an <hi>Angel Cloath'd,</hi> there with <hi>Linnen,</hi> here with a <hi>Clou'd,</hi> a Bright <hi>Clou'd,</hi> as it were <hi>Fine Linnen;</hi> there Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>Waters,</hi> or over them, here on the <hi>Sea,</hi> and on the <hi>Earth;</hi> Lifting up both his <hi>Hands</hi> to <hi>Heaven</hi> there, his <hi>Right Hand</hi> here, as the Principall, and Inclusive of Both; <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Him,</hi> that Liveth <hi>for Ever and Ever</hi> there, and here by Him that <hi>Liveth for Ever and Ever,</hi> and that made the <hi>whole Ʋniverse;</hi> In all these there is so Little Variation, that the <hi>Harmony</hi> is as Great as among the <hi>Evangelists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet these Agreements are Small in Comparison of these Three Essential Congruities.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Both the <hi>Oaths</hi> are with Relation to <hi>Time;</hi> the <hi>Oath</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> is, There shall be <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half a Time:</hi> The <hi>Oath</hi> here is, There shall be <hi>Time no More;</hi> and in a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berhood to this <hi>Oath</hi> (though indeed, as we shall Find; They make up with it the Time Allow'd to this <hi>Vision, as</hi> prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or Foregoing parts of the whole) <hi>Time, Times, half Time viz.</hi> the Twice <hi>Forty Two Months,</hi> the Twice 1260. <hi>Days,</hi> and once the very <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half Time;</hi> and to the same sense, though with Variation of words, once also <hi>Three days,</hi> and a <hi>Half;</hi> That <hi>Oath in Dan.</hi> having therefore determin'd, Such <hi>Times shall</hi> be; This <hi>Oath</hi> determines; There shall be no more <hi>Time,</hi> than these <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Half;</hi> and all with Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Scattering</hi> the <hi>Holy Peoples Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Both the <hi>Oaths</hi> have a Close Relation to an ultimate Finiture or Finishing; For the <hi>Oath</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> Says; All these Things, Call'd <hi>Wonders Dan.</hi> 12. Shall be <hi>Finished.</hi> And in this <hi>Oath</hi> the <hi>Mistery of God</hi> shall be <hi>Finished.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Both the <hi>Oaths</hi> lead to some Time Allow'd further for Great Action in order to a <hi>Blessed</hi> State or End. For upon the <hi>Oath</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> There is an Addition of 30. Days to the 1260. Days, into which the <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Half</hi> are Expounded, <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 11. 12. 13.</note> making 1290, and then 45. more, making 1335; the <hi>waitng</hi> and <hi>Coming</hi> to which is pronounced <hi>Blessed;</hi> and <hi>Dan.</hi> is promis'd a <hi>Lot</hi> therein: Accordingly in this <hi>Oath</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here are the <hi>Days</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Angel,</hi> when <hi>He Shall Begin to Sound;</hi> And the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet</hi> Finishes the <hi>Mistery,</hi> One Principal Branch of which is Giving <hi>Reward to the Servants of God, the Prophets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Revel. 11. 18.</note> Among which <hi>Daniel</hi> was <hi>Greatly Belov'd;</hi> Thus Certain It is These Two <hi>Oaths</hi> do Essentially Convene and Unite one in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100645:19"/> Another. They Cannot therefore Possibly Encounter, but must be to one Another, as the <hi>Impress,</hi> and <hi>Reverse</hi> in the same Medal: The <hi>Impress,</hi> There shall be <hi>Time, Times, and a Half;</hi> The <hi>Reverse,</hi> There shall be no more <hi>Time,</hi> then those <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Half;</hi> except the <hi>Time of the Seventh Trumpet</hi> for <hi>Finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> till the <hi>Sabbathism, Time</hi> of Another <hi>Species,</hi> Ensues.</p>
            <p>We must enter therefore into a strict Enquiry of the <hi>Time,</hi> when this latter <hi>Oath, Time shall be no more,</hi> Could take Place, without any Infraction upon the Former; which we are sure, It could not make, because the <hi>Oaths</hi> are so suited one to the other, as that the latter is in Confirmation, and Complement also of the Former.</p>
            <p>Let us then in the First place State concerning the Two <hi>Oaths,</hi> and what It is, that Each <hi>Oath</hi> Requires; and what will Follow from the Things Requir'd by Them; And that therefore must be Certainly Answered, and <hi>so</hi> we shall be directed upon the very Time of <hi>this Vision,</hi> and <hi>Oath,</hi> taking place, and behold the Admirable Agreement of the Two <hi>Oaths</hi> between Themselves, and of the <hi>Vision</hi> with them Both.</p>
            <p>The First <hi>Oath</hi> then Requires, that there should be <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half a Time,</hi> as a Time of Delay, or before the <hi>Finishing of Wonders;</hi> And that at the <hi>Finishing</hi> of the <hi>Scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Holy People,</hi> There should be a <hi>Finishing</hi> of all Those, <hi>viz. Wonders.</hi> This is Exprest in <hi>Daniel,</hi> For the <hi>Angel</hi> Answers the Question, Unto how Long or at what <hi>Length</hi> of Time shall be the <hi>End of Wonders?</hi> The Answer is, That for <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half a Time,</hi> and at the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 6. 7.</note> of the <hi>Scattering the Power of the Holy People, All These,</hi> that is, <hi>Wonders,</hi> Concerning which the Question was, shall be <hi>Finish'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Answer, there must be some supply to fill up the sense; For the Oath runs thus, <hi>That unto Time,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>unto the Half of Time,</hi> and <hi>when He shall Accomplish</hi> or <hi>in the Accomplishing</hi> to <hi>Scatter</hi> the <hi>Power of the Holy People, All shall be Finish'd:</hi> Now these words make not up Full sense with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Assuming most naturally from the latter clause; <hi>There shall be</hi> a <hi>scattering</hi> the <hi>Holy People</hi> for <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half of a Time,</hi> and in the <hi>Accomplishing</hi> to <hi>scatter, All these wonders</hi> shall be <hi>Finish'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And those words <hi>(shall be Finish'd)</hi> must be Expounded, (shall be in an immediate Course of <hi>Finishing:)</hi> to which are Allowed the 75 <hi>Years</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> just now spoken of; which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100645:20"/> therefore must needs be the <hi>Days of the Seventh Angel</hi> in this Chapter, wherein the <hi>Mistery shall be Finish'd</hi> into the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> by the <hi>Voices and the Vials;</hi> whose Motion is swift, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and Immediate, according to the <hi>quick Coming</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Trumpet:</hi> And thus the <hi>First Oath</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> requires.</p>
            <p>The latter <hi>Oath</hi> in this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> in full Agreement with the former requires, there should be no more <hi>Time, Times,</hi> nor <hi>Half Time,</hi> which the former <hi>Oath</hi> Allowed; But that at the <hi>Seventh Angel Beginning,</hi> (as we well translate <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to <hi>sound,</hi> and all the while, He is <hi>sounding,</hi> the <hi>Mystery</hi> should be in <hi>Finishing,</hi> till <hi>Finish'd in the Kingdom</hi> in Glory.</p>
            <p>It follows then from the first <hi>Oath,</hi> that the <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half a Time,</hi> and the <hi>scattering</hi> the <hi>Holy People</hi> must be together; and that all that <hi>Time, Finishing the wonders</hi> should have no place; But then it requires also, that the <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Half,</hi> and the <hi>scattering</hi> should end together; and that at the very end of the <hi>scattering,</hi> or in the <hi>Finishing</hi> of that, the <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> should be in <hi>Finishing</hi> also, and come on immediatly in those Forenam'd <hi>Seventy five years</hi> to be <hi>Finish'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the latter <hi>Oath</hi> it follows; That there must be a Point of Time, when it might be sworn, <hi>Time should be no more;</hi> So a point of Time, wherein in the Sense, It was <hi>Sworn,</hi> It might be actually said, <hi>Time is no more;</hi> That that Time must be a Time of <hi>Finishing;</hi> and that it must be, as soon, as ever the <hi>Days</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Angels sounding Begin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From both these <hi>Oaths</hi> in Agreement it follows; that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> begins to <hi>Finish,</hi> the <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Half,</hi> and the <hi>scattering</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Holy People</hi> must be at an end; For during those, there could be no <hi>Finishing;</hi> But by the <hi>First Oath,</hi> when they end, there must be <hi>Finishing,</hi> and by the latter <hi>Oath,</hi> there must be no more such <hi>Times</hi> of <hi>scattering,</hi> but the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> must <hi>Finish;</hi> Accordingly we find the <hi>Holy Peoples scattering</hi> to cease by the <hi>Witnesses Rising,</hi> and <hi>Ascending;</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> Consequentially <hi>Coming out of the Wilderness,</hi> just before the <hi>Seventh Trumpet sounds,</hi> and proceeds to <hi>Finish</hi> by the <hi>Voices,</hi> and the <hi>Vials;</hi> wherein <note place="margin">Rev. 11. 11. 14.</note> the Harmony of <hi>Prophesies</hi> is Admirable; Then therefore must be the end of <hi>Times,</hi> and a <hi>Half.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from All this that cannot be denied, It is so express in <hi>Prophecy;</hi> One must needs be very prone to think, there could be no Time, wherein it could be <hi>Sworn, Time shall be</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:100645:20"/>
               <hi>no more,</hi> but at the very end of <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Half;</hi> when really and Actually, <hi>Time</hi> of those sorts of <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Half</hi> shall <hi>be no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here give leave to Interpose a Caution against the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, as some pious minds in Contemplation of <hi>Eternity</hi> may be apt to do, that the meaning of the <hi>Oath</hi> is; There shall be no more <hi>Time</hi> at all, but <hi>Eternity</hi> shall ensue. Now though the Meditation hereupon may be High, Holy, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and Heavenly, and certainly shall be True in its Time; Yet it is certain by the compare of the <hi>Oaths,</hi> the Rule of Interpretation; The <hi>Oath</hi> Intends Time of such a kind, as the <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half</hi> were; shall <hi>be no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas it may be very well thought, there could no such <hi>Oath,</hi> as this, have place; Till those <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Half,</hi> are actually Run out; and that therefore the <hi>Vision,</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> so closely joyn'd must take their place at that Time; Yet by the three Notes of <hi>Estoppage</hi> of <hi>Finishing,</hi> we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd; Both the <hi>Oath</hi> and the <hi>Vision</hi> find their place of Entry before.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Sealing</hi> the <hi>Thunders</hi> of so great service to <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,</hi> must be most contrary to <hi>Finishing,</hi> which yet is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the <hi>Vision; Finishing</hi> therefore could not be at the same Time with the <hi>Vision;</hi> and therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> not at the <hi>Half Time</hi> ended, when <hi>Finishing</hi> must be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Book eaten</hi> and <hi>bitter in the Belly</hi> is most contrary to <hi>Finishing;</hi> For else the <hi>Book</hi> had been as <hi>sweet io the Belly,</hi> as in the <hi>Mouth,</hi> as was before Explain'd: But that also the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> commands, and therefore is not at the <hi>Half Time</hi> ended to have its place, but before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Prophecying again</hi> is most contrary to <hi>Finishing;</hi> For as to <hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>the sufferings of Christ,</hi> after he had said, <hi>It is Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd,</hi> had been to deny Him the <hi>Redeemer;</hi> So contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would it be to his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to <hi>Prophecy</hi> of it, when it is <hi>Come;</hi> But the <hi>Vision</hi> at the same Time with the <hi>Oath</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionates <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Prophecy again:</hi> Therefore it must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Finishing</hi> had place, therefore before the <hi>Seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> therefore before the <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Half Time</hi> ended.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vision and Oath</hi> must have place therefore within some part of <hi>Half Time,</hi> else it could not have been <hi>sworn; Time shall be no more,</hi> without overthrowing the <hi>former Oath,</hi> that such <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Half</hi> should be; It must be in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100645:21"/> of <hi>Half Time,</hi> else the Notes of <hi>Estoppage</hi> so essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the <hi>Vision</hi> could not have had Time to be decently Born.</p>
            <p>It must therefore in the very Beginning of <hi>Half Time,</hi> even as soon as ever there was such a diminution of <hi>Half Time,</hi> as that any of the Atoms, or sands of it were Run out, and that it was no longer an entire <hi>Canton</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Time, Times, Half Time;</hi> (For <hi>Half Time,</hi> though it be but <hi>Half Time,</hi> is as entire a <hi>Canton of Time</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Oath,</hi> as any of the rest) As soon as ever <hi>Half Time</hi> was broken, that it was no longer <hi>Half Time</hi> it gave place, and yielded to this <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Christ, Time shall be no more;</hi> As soon as ever It was not a due just <hi>Half Time,</hi> this <hi>Oath of Christ</hi> entred; There shall never to <hi>Eternity</hi> any morebe such a <hi>Half Time,</hi> much less <hi>Time,</hi> or <hi>Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christ took the very first Advantage, as soon as <hi>Half Time</hi> had lost it felf, and <hi>swore;</hi> Now <hi>Time, viz.</hi> any <hi>Canton of Time,</hi> not <hi>Time,</hi> nor <hi>Times,</hi> nay, not so much as <hi>Half Time</hi> shall be any more for ever.</p>
            <p>It is true, This was Implyed in the <hi>first Oath,</hi> as hath been shewn: But here it is not only seconded, but made more open; and it is true also, this <hi>Vision</hi> and so the <hi>Oath</hi> was Represented to <hi>John</hi> long before, either <hi>Times,</hi> or <hi>Half Time</hi> entred, even when this <hi>Prophecy</hi> was given; But it was but in <hi>Vision</hi> and not suppos'd to be, till the <hi>Vision</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> took place together; As we well know according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Vision,</hi> which Represents things as in being, and yet not to be, till their <hi>Appointed Time;</hi> So this <hi>Vision,</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> of Christ are given, as if they were then, and yet not to be, till their just season.</p>
            <p>As soon therefore, as one Minute of <hi>Half Time</hi> was gone, It is according to the Law of <hi>Vision</hi> to be suppos'd; <hi>Christ swore,</hi> and not till then; For when one Minute of <hi>Half Time</hi> was gone, it was broken immediately; It could not then be, so much as <hi>Half Time</hi> any more for ever; For though Leave was given to it to run out its last dust, e're the Time of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing</hi> shall enter; Yet as soon as ever the first dust of it was spent, it Abated of, it departed from it self; and ever after every minute it spends, it is still less, and less <hi>Half Time,</hi> till it is no <hi>Time</hi> at all in any sense.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:100645:21"/>
            <p> But as soon, as ever the Web of <hi>Half Time</hi> had but an Edg, a Border, a Selvage of it clipp'd, or rather worn off by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out; It was no longer the <hi>Half Time</hi> of <hi>Prophecy</hi> as a day is not a day, when any the smallest particle of the Twenty Four Hours is to be defalk'd, as spent, when the first Minute is spent; For <hi>Prophecy</hi> is exact to a Grain, a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a Minute, a Second, every Fraction of a Second, even as <hi>Astronomy</hi> would be: And as soon as ever the first, the least <hi>Ramentum</hi> or shaving of <hi>Half Time</hi> was taken off, the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> Interpos'd; There shall never be <hi>Time any more</hi> according to those distributions of <hi>Time, Times,</hi> or the last, and least part, <hi>Half Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore most demonstrative, this <hi>Oath</hi> according to the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half Time</hi> could be no sooner, then the morning of <hi>Half Time:</hi> It could not be so much as a minute before it; For then the <hi>Half Time</hi> had been entire, and if so, it had been <hi>Time</hi> according to the Sense of <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and then one of the <hi>Oaths</hi> must have fail'd; For either the <hi>Half Time</hi> had been cut off by the last <hi>Oath,</hi> and no <hi>Half Time</hi> had ensued, contrary to the <hi>Former Oath;</hi> or it had stood according to the <hi>Former Oath,</hi> and the latter <hi>Oath</hi> had effected nothing but fallen to the Ground by <hi>Half Time,</hi> which in the sense of <hi>Prophecy</hi> is <hi>Time,</hi> coming in its order, notwithstanding this last <hi>Oath;</hi> But either of these Supposals is impossible, for if <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> shall pass, but not a <hi>Jot</hi> of the <hi>words</hi> of Christ shall <hi>pass;</hi> How much less of his <hi>Oath,</hi> it being the Greater and more Immutable of those <hi>Two things,</hi> wherein <hi>It is impossible for him to lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when <hi>Half Time</hi> by spending any, the least part of it self was degraded, dismounted from being <hi>Half Time;</hi> Then there was not any of those <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> left, that could in the Ballance of the former <hi>Oath</hi> be call'd <hi>Time,</hi> but only a Remainder of <hi>Half Time</hi> already entred, and some part spent of it; Christ might then well <hi>Swear,</hi> there shall never now be <hi>Time</hi> any <hi>more;</hi> not so much a <hi>Canton of Time,</hi> as <hi>Half Time</hi> was, and yet this <hi>Oath</hi> might very well also Reserve to <hi>Half Time</hi> the Allowance to run out it self; As on the very dawn of the last day of a mans Life, It may be truly said to him; He shall never have a day more, tho' he live to the very last minute of that day already entred.</p>

            <p> At the very possibility therefore, it could be done with Justice to the former <hi>Oath,</hi> Christ zealous of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> Foreclos'd all Future Time for delay; He entred his Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Protestation against any more <hi>Time,</hi> or so much as <hi>Half Time;</hi> Here then may this <hi>Oath</hi> take place, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some of <hi>Half Time</hi> expended for his former <hi>Oaths</hi> sake; but as soon as any of it was expended, that it was not Time according to any, the least <hi>Canton of Time</hi> in that <hi>Oath,</hi> for his <hi>Kingdoms sake,</hi> he <hi>sware, Time shall be no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As He settled <hi>Time, Times, Half a Time</hi> with an <hi>Oath</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>Fathers Counsel</hi> concerning the delay of his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> so according to the same <hi>Counsel</hi> He <hi>Jealous</hi> for his <hi>Kingdom</hi> fix'd an Immovable Barr against any more <hi>Time, Times,</hi> or so much as <hi>Half Time</hi> with an <hi>Oath</hi> also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Affirm.</hi> 2. Having thus far established my first Affirmation concerning this <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Time, viz.</hi> That there is a definite Time, when this <hi>Vision,</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> are to take place, and that It is at <hi>Half Time</hi> so entred, as to be the entire <hi>Time</hi> of <hi>Half Time</hi> no longer; And that this <hi>Half Time</hi> is to end together with the <hi>Types</hi> of this <hi>Vision</hi> for <hi>Estoppage</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> when the <hi>Seventh Angel</hi> shall, but <hi>Begin</hi> to <hi>sound;</hi> I come now to the second Affirmation; That this Time is such, as must necessarily according to this <hi>Vision</hi> compar'd with the whole <hi>Prophecy,</hi> be the Time of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and that It can be no other Time.</p>
            <p>To Argue this, I will only Remember the proof, I have already given, that this <hi>Vision</hi> is the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> But because I would further promote from this <hi>Type</hi> the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments already given, that this <hi>Vision</hi> is the <hi>Vision</hi> of the of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> I will not Insist upon what I have done, but go on to prove further; That as this <hi>Oath</hi> hath been even Demonstrated according to this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> to have been at the <hi>Half Time,</hi> and that it could be at no Point else; So I shall now Argue, that the <hi>Reformation</hi> could be at no other Point of Time, but of <hi>Half Time</hi> begun; and therefore also that this <hi>Vision</hi> must needs be the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Argument is this: The <hi>Little Horn,</hi> who is also call'd <hi>the Beast</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> even as in this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> had assur'd to him <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Half a Time,</hi> which are in this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> cap. 13. Expounded into <hi>Forty two Months;</hi> and he was to Rise to a <hi>Kingdom</hi> by degrees; And when He
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100645:23"/> should <hi>Ascend from the Bottomless Pit,</hi> and attain his <hi>Number</hi> 666. It was <hi>given to him,</hi> that he should have <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> in his <hi>Hand,</hi> or an <hi>Ʋniversal Monarchy;</hi> or as in this <hi>Prophecy, Power</hi> was <hi>given to him</hi> over all <hi>Kindreds, Tongues,</hi> and <hi>Nations;</hi> and that because of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> either as prepar'd for by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or erected from its Infant state, or come to its height, the <hi>Witnesses</hi> should <hi>put on Sackcloth</hi> for 1260 <hi>Days;</hi> and by Consequence the <hi>Church</hi> should be in the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,</hi> or in a lost hidden or <hi>Scatter'd</hi> State; and that in some <hi>Deep</hi> part of this <hi>Time,</hi> the <hi>Witnesses</hi> should be <hi>war'd with, overcome</hi> and <hi>kill'd</hi> by Him; and thereby the <hi>Church</hi> hid so close, that the <hi>Serpent</hi> knew not how to find it.</p>
            <p>It Becomes therefore a Great doubt, how there should be such an Appearance of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> such a Comming of some part of the <hi>witnesses,</hi> as it were out of <hi>Sackcloath,</hi> and some parts of the <hi>Church,</hi> as it seems, out of the <hi>Wilderness</hi> into so <hi>Visible</hi> a State, as in the <hi>Reformation;</hi> and thereby a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> by so many of <hi>Tongues, Kindreds,</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> Refusing to serve Him any Longer: and that too within <hi>Half Time</hi> and before the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> for <hi>Finishing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One must be here again very Enclin'd to deem, that as in the former Case, we might be Ready to Think It could not be <hi>Sworn, Time shall be no more,</hi> till <hi>Half Time</hi> was Run out; So that this Change of Things could neither be till then: Each of them seems a like, hardly Reconcileable with <hi>Prophesie;</hi> which yet yeilds such a Resemblance of the <hi>Oath</hi> with the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> in this matter, that may make us Apt to Believe, They are Closely Related in point of Time, and Both one and the same way, to be Reconcil'd to that Seemingly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring <hi>Prophecy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>wisdom</hi> of the <hi>Lord God of the Holy Prophets</hi> is therefore to be observ'd by the <hi>Minds,</hi> that <hi>Have Wisdom.</hi> For the space Allow'd to the <hi>Beasts Kingdom,</hi> and to the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> and of his <hi>Witnesses</hi> under it, hath not Fortuitously, by Accident, or on any small Reason been destributed into Three <hi>Cantons, viz. Time, Times,</hi> or <hi>Two Times</hi> so Combin'd, as to be Two in <hi>One,</hi> or One in Two, in regard of Uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and into <hi>Half Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But upon this Great Reason they are so distributed; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause It was Fore-determin'd, and so also Fore-seen, and so
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100645:24"/> also Fore-told, that the <hi>Beast</hi> would be almost the whole First <hi>Time</hi> Climbing up to his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> And this must needs be a different State from his supreme Regnancy. For First He hath <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were to be his People, pressing into the <hi>Empire</hi> and so into the <hi>outer Court</hi> at 437. Then He Rises out of the <hi>Sea</hi> at his Succession at 475. or 476. But He was a Long Time Obscure, Un-Notable; Then He Rises out of the <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temless Pit,</hi> by the name of <hi>Ʋniversal Bishop, Supreme Pastor</hi> at 606; then He Attains his <hi>Number</hi> at 725. Then He <hi>makes War, Overcomes, Kills</hi> by that <hi>Council of Nice</hi> 787. within Ten Years of the End of his First <hi>Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From thence as a Grown Establish'd Prince, His <hi>Kingdom</hi> is Equal, and alike in the main, however Spreading and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching during the <hi>Two Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the <hi>Half Time</hi> There is a Retrenchment of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> by the <hi>Reformation</hi> both as to the Universality, and uncontrole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as we shall see, Beginning 1517.</p>
            <p>And thus It is Proportionably in the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Woman</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and by necessary Consequence upon her self; These are Greater or Less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Beasts Tyrany;</hi> First, The <hi>Witnesses</hi> Bear a <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in Sackloth;</hi> Then they <hi>Finish their Testimony;</hi> Then they are <hi>Overcome, Kill▪d, Lye Dead,</hi> till a part mov'd to a <hi>Rising;</hi> according to which the <hi>Church</hi> was more or Less out of Sight in the <hi>Wilderness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to Convey us into all this variety, There is first the distribution of the Twice 1260. days, and twice <hi>Forty two Months</hi> into <hi>Time, Times, Half a Time,</hi> that the Changes, which the Intire Uniformness of the <hi>Months</hi> and <hi>Days</hi> could not Represent; the <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half Time,</hi> as in a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral view might Give us: A Stupendious Contrivance of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Least this might not Enough Inform us; By a Close observation of the words chosen in the <hi>Originals, Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> There is a Significancy of Time with Opportunity or <hi>Seasons,</hi> and <hi>Indicted Appointed Times;</hi> A Contrivance yet more Stupendious.</p>
            <p>But behold still the further <hi>Manifold Wisdom of Prophecy,</hi> Least we might Think, All and the whole of <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Half Time,</hi> was <hi>Season</hi> or <hi>Deep Time,</hi> These <hi>Times,</hi> or <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> and <hi>Half</hi> are, as I may say, put into the Habit, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100645:24"/> dress of <hi>Three days,</hi> and a <hi>Half,</hi> and into so Close an Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, and Allusion to our <hi>Lords Three days</hi> in the <hi>Grave,</hi> that we may not miss to Take notice, that there was a Great difference between the <hi>First</hi> and the <hi>Last Part</hi> of the <hi>First</hi> of those <hi>Three days;</hi> That the <hi>Second day</hi> was a like; and that the Precedent part untill the very <hi>morning</hi> of the <hi>Third day,</hi> while It was yet <hi>dark,</hi> and all the Rest of that <hi>Third day</hi> Exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Differ'd from one another; So Differ'd the <hi>First</hi> and the <hi>Last</hi> part of the <hi>First Time,</hi> or <hi>day</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> and of the <hi>Church;</hi> The <hi>Two days</hi> or <hi>Times</hi> were much alike; But then very different were the very Entrance of the <hi>Last Half Time,</hi> and the Following Part of it till the End, in regard of some of the <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>Witnesses</hi> by the <hi>Reformation:</hi> Oh the <hi>Heigth,</hi> and the <hi>Depth</hi> of this <hi>Prophetick Wisdom!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whoever misses this <hi>Key of Prophecy,</hi> and especially that of our <hi>Lords Time of Death,</hi> Leading us to make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction betwixt <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Close word for <hi>Oppertunity,</hi> Can never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>Apocalyptical Time,</hi> nor Find, how the <hi>Apostacy</hi> Should Begin so Early as 437. by the <hi>Gentiles Entring</hi> the <hi>Outward Court;</hi> the succession so Early as 475. and yet the <hi>Beast</hi> Gain'd not the Ascendent till 606. From thence indeed he proceed-amain to have have his <hi>Image worshipp'd</hi> at his <hi>Number</hi> as it were in words at length, <hi>viz.</hi> from 725 downwards till 787. Nor without this <hi>Key</hi> can the <hi>Reformation</hi> at 1517 be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to <hi>Prophecy,</hi> that Assigns an <hi>Ʋniversal Monarchy,</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>Scatter'd,</hi> to the <hi>Papacy</hi> for Forty two <hi>Months</hi> when loe so many <hi>Protestant Princes, States,</hi> and persons have turn'd themselves from him so much sooner; and so many <hi>Witnesses</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> have <hi>withstood</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Successor of <hi>Peter</hi> to the <hi>Face;</hi> and he knows not, however enrag'd he be, how to help it, while they are patroniz'd, by powers out of his reach so to do.</p>
            <p>It is therefore far from the Extravagancy, the <hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> Dr. <hi>Cressener</hi> charges, thus to Interpret <hi>Three days,</hi> and a <hi>Half,</hi> to signifie <hi>Three Times,</hi> and a <hi>Half.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is True 1260 <hi>Days</hi> in the same <hi>Vision,</hi> and so near, signifie no more Time, then those <hi>Three days</hi> and a <hi>Half;</hi> But when the Fundamental Reason of things necessitates us to seek ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Key</hi> for them, then according to the ordinary <hi>Cyphar</hi> of a <hi>Day</hi> for a <hi>Year,</hi> (which fully serves the purpose of the 1260.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100645:25"/> but can no way serve the <hi>Three days and a Half,)</hi> we are justified in so doing; For neither would the <hi>Beast</hi> lose so much Time of his Forty two <hi>Months</hi> as to stay till the last <hi>Three Years,</hi> and <hi>Half</hi> to <hi>Kill,</hi> and expose the <hi>Witnesses d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ad;</hi> nor would that Time possibly serve, as is fully discours'd in the <hi>Vision of the Witnesses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to what I have there said, I here super-add, if as we ought, we fetch the <hi>Three Times,</hi> and a <hi>Half</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Wilderness</hi> out of <hi>c.</hi> 12. 14. and match them with the <hi>Three days,</hi> and a <hi>Half</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses lying dead,</hi> and in open view; The Variation is very easie and even with Reference <note place="margin">
                  <hi>c.</hi> 11. 9.</note> to our <hi>Lords three days,</hi> even graceful; For there ought to be a Correspondence in each point of Time in <hi>Time</hi> at <hi>large,</hi> and in <hi>deep season</hi> or Intimate <hi>Opportunity</hi> betwixt the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> both on the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> part; as in the 1260 <hi>days,</hi> so in the <hi>Witnesses three days,</hi> and <hi>Half;</hi> which there would not be, if the <hi>Three days,</hi> and <hi>Half</hi> are not the same with <hi>Three Times</hi> and a <hi>Half;</hi> But if they are so taken, the Correspondence is Illustrious on both sides. For <hi>Day,</hi> we know throughout <hi>Scripture,</hi> Applys it self to all portions of Time.</p>
            <p>Indeed if we go about to match the <hi>Three days,</hi> and <hi>Half</hi> with the <hi>Twelve hundred Sixty dayes,</hi> as we ought not, (because though the word <hi>days</hi> is the same, and the space the same, yet the Scheme of Time design'd is vastly distant) the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of so great and so small a number of <hi>days,</hi> while yet the same space is Intended is very Rough, Harsh, and even Intollerable.</p>
            <p>But thus explain'd, as I have set out before every eye, the whole plot of Time Allowed to the <hi>Beastian Kingdom</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by it; For to the utmost stretch of <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Half</hi> at large, or 1260 <hi>days;</hi> The <hi>Beast</hi> is to have a <hi>Tyranny</hi> over the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>holy People,</hi> either preparing, or rising; or Remaining after Retrenchment; or else in full <hi>Supremacy.</hi> But for the deep and Intimate part, or <hi>deep Season</hi> of <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Halfs</hi> he must have a full, and Absolute <hi>Autonomy,</hi> or <hi>Supremacy</hi> to <hi>do after his own will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of this there seems to me to be an Eye, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 7. (There shall be <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Half</hi> for <hi>Dispersion;</hi> and when he shall have <hi>Accomplish'd</hi> to <hi>Disperse</hi> so or <hi>Scatter;)</hi> As if there would be a <hi>deep Time</hi> of <hi>dispersion,</hi> Answering the deep of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100645:25"/>
               <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Half,</hi> and then an exhausting, a drawing down to the very dreggs that <hi>dispersion,</hi> as in the last part of <hi>Time</hi> at large; at the end of which would ensue the <hi>seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi> for <hi>Finishing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this perfectly agrees to the <hi>Vision,</hi> we are upon, for Jesus Christ <hi>zealous</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> and of all the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of it, according to his <hi>Fathers Counsel,</hi> and according to his <hi>own Oath in Daniel,</hi> knowing that the <hi>deep Time,</hi> the Time of the Absolute <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> was expir'd; even as soon as ever the <hi>Little Horn,</hi> or <hi>Antichrist</hi> had had any part of the <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Twelve hundred Sixty days</hi> contain'd <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Half Time,</hi> both as <hi>Time</hi> at large, and as strict <hi>Time,</hi> and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; At the Time of this <hi>Vision,</hi> Deep, and Intimate <hi>Time</hi> in the 1260 <hi>days</hi> was so near spent, that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ Appears in the Foremention'd <hi>Types,</hi> together with that <hi>Oath, Time shall be no more;</hi> Hereon follows by the <hi>German Protestation,</hi> about Ten yeaars after a Famous Retrenchment of the <hi>Beasts Kingdom.</hi>

            <p> And thus I hope it will be clear, and evident to the <hi>Minds,</hi> that have <hi>Wisdom,</hi> that there is in this <hi>Vision</hi> a Manifestation both of the <hi>Appearance,</hi> and of the <hi>Estoppage</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> according to the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and according to undoubted experiment.</p>
            <p>And thus Christ took the opportunity before this, at the <hi>opening</hi> of the <hi>Sixth</hi> and <hi>Seventh seals,</hi> to make the <hi>Appearance</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> in the <hi>Christian Empire</hi> of <hi>Constantine</hi> and his Successors; Although he knew there were the <hi>Twelve Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Sixty days</hi> to come, as an <hi>Estoppage</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and that in the first of them, the Remainder of that very <hi>Christian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> would be <hi>Antichristianiz'd;</hi> which <hi>Antichristianism</hi> was to be, and hath been a long, and a most Pressing <hi>Estoppage</hi> of his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> And yet to this he yielded, according as hath been said, to his <hi>Fathers Counsel,</hi> and his own <hi>Oath in Daniel;</hi> so that he gave the <hi>Appearance of his Kingdom</hi> in those Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Manly Birth, Jesus Christ, Caught up not only to Heaven,</hi> but to the very <hi>Throne of God;</hi> And so that he Retains the <hi>Imperial Name,</hi> however undermin'd by <hi>Antichrist</hi> to this day; The <hi>Dragon,</hi> or <hi>Sathan</hi> in the <hi>Pagan Empire</hi> was so <hi>cast out of Heaven,</hi> that his <hi>place is found there no more;</hi> the <hi>Paganism</hi> being either <hi>Antichristianiz'd,</hi> which carries the name of Christ under it; or <hi>Mahometiz'd,</hi> which is, as hath been said an <hi>Antichristianism</hi> rather to <hi>Antichrist</hi> then to Christ, a Mock-state Intruding as a Judgment, and as a <hi>Paraselene dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Beasts Moons.</hi> There was therefore so Great a <hi>Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy;</hi> The <hi>Kingdom of our God is come, &amp;c.</hi> Yet together with these Notes of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> were given also the Notes of <hi>Estoppage</hi> in the 144000 Immediately <hi>Seal▪d,</hi> in the <hi>Churches Flight</hi> into the <hi>Wilderness;</hi> All which just there <hi>Hunt</hi> or tread in the very <hi>Footsteps</hi> of the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Lords Annointed</hi> in the <hi>Christian Empire;</hi> From all which it appears, It is the manner of this <hi>Prophecy</hi> to omit no just season of shewing the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> but till the <hi>Finishing,</hi> to give together with the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> the <hi>Types</hi> of <hi>Estoppage,</hi> and so here in the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus the Second Affirmation being Established, I come to the Third.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Affirm.</hi> 3. The Time of the <hi>Vision,</hi> and of the <hi>Oath</hi> thus demonstrated must determine the Time, when the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> shall be no Longer in so Low a State, or indeed, when
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100645:26"/> the <hi>Reformation</hi> It self shall be <hi>Reform'd</hi> by the Action of the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> Hastning All Things to the <hi>Finishing</hi> the <hi>Mistery,</hi> or to the <hi>Appearance</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> For at the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> shall be in its Succession, but not Immediately <hi>Appear in Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Follows with Ease, and of it self; For if, as hath been prov'd, the very <hi>Dawn</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> be the Dawn also of <hi>Half Time,</hi> and of this <hi>Vision</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> Taking Place; seeing we know the <hi>Reformation</hi> so dawn'd at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>517. in <hi>Luther,</hi> we easily Compute the Just distribution of the 1260 <hi>days</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Time</hi> 360 years; <hi>Two Times</hi> 720 years; and <hi>Half Time</hi> 180 years. So the present State of Things Beginning at 1517. and having an <hi>hundred Eighty years</hi> for their Race; They must needs End at at 1697; when the <hi>Reformation</hi> shall be under a <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> and the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> succeed to <hi>Finish the Mistery</hi> into the <hi>Kingdom of Christ Appearing in Glory;</hi> In the mean time Things are to be under <hi>Estoppage,</hi> and delay.</p>
            <p>There Remains nothing upon this part of the Discourse in my Thoughts, but to Remove, what may seem a Great objection to this Adjustment of the <hi>Oath of Christ,</hi> this <hi>Vision,</hi> the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and <hi>Half Time</hi> one to Another. And that is; That immediately after the <hi>Commission</hi> Renew'd to <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Prophecy again;</hi> the whole, and Entire <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> and of the 1260 days from their puting on <hi>Sackcloth</hi> to their <hi>Rising, Ascension,</hi> and the Great Consequence, or Concurrents of them are Given together, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. So the <hi>Reformation</hi> shall have a <hi>Vision,</hi> and in its Just place; And It is unreasonable to Give it any other <hi>Vision,</hi> or so Antedated to the Proper <hi>Order,</hi> and place of it as in the <hi>Vision of the Witnesses</hi> to which It properly Belongs; whereas the Relation of the <hi>Reformation</hi> to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Seizure of <hi>Constantinople</hi> is in an Undue Order of Time, and therefore not the Real Order of the <hi>Vision.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To this objection I will advance a very Breif Anwer in these Six particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of Concession, or Allowance, that the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> must be suppos'd to have vertually a place in the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and by this <hi>Vision</hi> we know where it must be; Even as soon, as ever the <hi>Deep Time</hi> of the 1260 days, that is, at the Dawn, or Morning of the <hi>Half day;</hi> For then the <hi>Witnesses</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> Gave a <hi>Dawn,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:100645:27"/> and a Pre-Appearance, and a pledge of the Full <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and of the whole <hi>Christian Church</hi> coming out of the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> by their open Avowed <hi>Testimony,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This notwithstanding, So Great an Appearance of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> as was at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> Requir'd such a particular <hi>Vision</hi> of it, as in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> to which nothing Else Answers in Time, or order in <hi>History;</hi> Nor is that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily suppos'd place, the <hi>Reformation</hi> hath in the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> Clear, Illustious Enough for the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as hath already been urg'd on all sides of this matter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This <hi>Vision of the Reformation</hi> hath not only a Just pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance in order, and Time to the seizure of the <hi>Antichristian Eastern Empire</hi> by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but a stricter and nearer one to the <hi>Impenitency,</hi> being the Beginning, and a pledge of those <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic Judgments</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> for the utter destruction of the <hi>Antichristian Kingdom; viz</hi> by the Appearance of Christ Himself; according to 2 Thess. 2. for which the <hi>Mahometan Woes</hi> were too Forreign, and Aloof; And so the occasion Tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en is that <hi>Impenitency</hi> of the <hi>Western,</hi> more <hi>Antichristian Empire,</hi> notwithstanding that so dreadful <hi>Woe,</hi> upon which a <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> specific for destroying that <hi>Antichristian Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Mahometan Tyranny,</hi> the mock of it together, is in its Pre-Appearance Display'd in this <hi>Vision;</hi> Thus as Christ says Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that very <hi>Church of Thyatyra,</hi> in which the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> first Appear'd; I <hi>Gave</hi> to the <hi>Spiritual Jezebel space to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and she <hi>Repented not;</hi> So she is to be <hi>Cast into the Bed of Flames,</hi> into which the <hi>Vials</hi> shall bring that <hi>Roman Apostate Church,</hi> of which the <hi>Reformation is the Pledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It is very natural to <hi>History,</hi> (besides the secrecy of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy)</hi> to Give the Relation of an Illustrious Event in its just Place, and order; and then to give the whole Family, as it were, and Pedegree, and full <hi>History</hi> of that Event together, Leaving out in that Fuller Relation, what had been first Given of it; This <hi>Prophecy</hi> Gives the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> just in the due order, the Time, and Place; and Gives the <hi>Vision of the Witnesses,</hi> which Comprehends the <hi>Reformation</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the latter part, and yet Leaves out any one Open Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Reformation</hi> there, because, It was Given before.</p>

               <hi>Point</hi> of the Command to <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Prophecy again</hi> before <hi>People, Tongues,</hi> and <hi>Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> Giving a <hi>Prophecy</hi> of 1260 days <hi>Prophecy</hi> in <hi>Sackcloth</hi> before <hi>People, Tongues,</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> (For before whom, They Lay Dead, They also <hi>Prophecy)</hi> which Course of <hi>Sackcloth Prophecy</hi> Seeming to be Interupted by the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and by the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> Appearing, as in a pledge of it; <hi>John</hi> Sustaining the person of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> in <hi>Prophetick Type</hi> is made to Know; The Time of <hi>Sackcloth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> by a Great part of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> was not past, but must upon that seeming Interruption (as in <hi>Vision</hi> only) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin again, till the 1260 <hi>days</hi> quite Ended. Thus these Two <hi>Visions</hi> are Fitly Joynted one into Another at a just Point.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd together, sets the whole State of the <hi>Prophetical Time,</hi> with Relation to the <hi>Beastian Kingdom,</hi> and to the <hi>Suffering</hi> of the <hi>Holy People,</hi> Right, and Strait; and Keeps it Tight to its Just <hi>Epoch,</hi> or Beginning, and to its <hi>Period</hi> or End: which can no way be so Easily, and manifestly Assur'd as by this <hi>Vision.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Witnesses</hi> have 1260 <hi>days,</hi> wherein They must <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> in <hi>Sackloth;</hi> and the <hi>Woman,</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> as so united with the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> must needs have 1260 <hi>days</hi> also; and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and the <hi>Beast</hi> 42 <hi>Months,</hi> Answering together the 1260 <hi>days</hi> as the Cause of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> and of the <hi>Churches Sufferings:</hi> These <hi>days,</hi> and <hi>Months</hi> on the <hi>Beasts</hi> part and on the <hi>Witnssees,</hi> and on the <hi>Cburches</hi> part are Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd into Three <hi>Times,</hi> and a <hi>Half;</hi> and for that Peculiar Reason already Given, call'd <hi>Three Days,</hi> and a <hi>Half</hi> on the <hi>Witnesses</hi> sole part; but from <hi>Parity</hi> of Reason must needs be the same with <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and a <hi>Half</hi> as hath been shown.</p>
            <p>Who now can Believe with any show of Reason, that so many, and so distinct Characters of Time should be Given only to Crucifie search and Inquiry, by that <hi>Spirit,</hi> that hath Commanded us to <hi>Search Scripture;</hi> and that the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and the End of these Times can by no certain Test of this <hi>Prophecy</hi> be cettainly Known?</p>
            <p>I Acknowledge, There are many other ways by which we may be Assur'd, as I have elsewere Argued; And it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not according to Common Computation, from the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations <hi>Prophecy</hi> Gives to <hi>Search,</hi> as High, as <hi>Constantine</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:100645:28"/> but be every day expected, The 1260 <hi>days</hi> should End, the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses Rise,</hi> and <hi>Ascend,</hi> the <hi>Beastian Power</hi> and of his <hi>City</hi> Fall, and the <hi>Seventh Trumpet Sound</hi> to <hi>Finishing;</hi> Seeing by All Signs we Know; They must needs be near their End; and that They are not yet Ended; as by all things else, so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by that, that the <hi>Turkish Woe</hi> is not yet Remov'd from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> nor from the <hi>Greek Churches;</hi> which is the most Loughty <hi>Pirami'd</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> distinguishing betwixt the <hi>Sixth,</hi> and the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> that could be by <hi>Prophecy</hi> Given.</p>
            <p>But what is there more plain than what I have now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to <hi>Fix</hi> this whole Time? At no other Time, but <hi>Half Time</hi> Could the <hi>Oath,</hi> or the <hi>Reformation</hi> according to the <hi>Types</hi> of this <hi>Vision</hi> be; If then the <hi>Reformation</hi> be at the <hi>Half Time,</hi> and the <hi>Half Time</hi> at the <hi>Reformation;</hi> we must necessarily Know, how far back the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> must Run with all its Concurrents even to the Year of General Christian Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count 437. where also the <hi>First Trumpet</hi> Began, and so End at 1697. All which cannot be so Readily, plainly, and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively, and to Full satisfaction Known, as by this <hi>Vision;</hi> So that with Admirable Conduct of the Divine <hi>Prophetick Spirit</hi> was It prefix'd to the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> as Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridling the 42 <hi>Months,</hi> the 1260 days, and the <hi>Three days,</hi> and <hi>Half</hi> in it; and so Proportionably the same Times, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to the <hi>Church,</hi> as the 42 <hi>Months;</hi> also to the <hi>Beast,</hi> and withal unlocking the Times of <hi>Daniel</hi> to us: <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Half</hi> Twice Given; and the 1290 and the 1335 days at the Time of <hi>Blessedness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot Find any place of doubt in this matter, Except we should Startle at dating the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and <hi>Half Time,</hi> so Early as <hi>Luthers</hi> Appearance at 1517. But if we Consider the undoubtedness of the <hi>Reformation</hi> Beginning in that <hi>Cloud,</hi> but as <hi>Big</hi> as a <hi>Mans Hand,</hi> and yet Going on so Continuedly; and that the very Earliest Time according to our <hi>Lords Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> while It was <hi>yet dark,</hi> is to be Taken, for the <hi>Angels Coming down,</hi> in Allusion <hi>Cloath'd</hi> in <hi>White,</hi> and as it were <hi>Rolling away the Stone</hi> from the <hi>Winesses</hi> Dead State, however <hi>Ʋnbury'd;</hi> sure our doubt must be Resolv'd, though the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> took some Further Time to display its <hi>Appearance,</hi> and when <hi>deep Time</hi> was more Expir'd, as at that <hi>Solemn Protestation</hi> of the <hi>German Princes</hi> about Ten years after; where I Think, the End of <hi>deep Time,</hi> as in the First Retrencement
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100645:28"/> of the <hi>Beasts Ʋniversal Monarchy</hi> is most conspicuously Fix'd; For <hi>Deep Time</hi> might have a place in <hi>Half Time,</hi> after Christ had <hi>sworn, Time of either sort</hi> could by the <hi>Oath</hi> be no longer <hi>Time</hi> according to the first <hi>Oath;</hi> that is, entire; For <hi>Deep Time,</hi> as it ought, was almost wholly spent, and <hi>Half Time at large</hi> was so impair'd as to be <hi>Half Time</hi> no longer: as hath been fully set out; and yet each might run out, whatever was left to either; which yet must needs be less then entire <hi>Time</hi> in the sense of that first <hi>Oath,</hi> even less then <hi>Time at large;</hi> much more so of <hi>deep Time,</hi> now almost wholly spent.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Fourth Point or General Head of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; that is, to consider, and to Argue according to the <hi>Types</hi> of this <hi>Vision,</hi> and according to matter of Fact, what must needs be the True Elevation of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> and wherein it all along ought to have born the <hi>Symbols</hi> of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ</hi> and its appearance, according to such the True Elevation of it; and wherein also on the same Account, It must needs fall below the <hi>Types</hi> of that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as <hi>Estopp'd,</hi> and Retir'd from its Appearance; and how long it must do so, and when there shall be a <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and <hi>Protestation</hi> at its full dimensions: Or wehn the <hi>Witnesses Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> and <hi>Ascending on Mount Sion</hi> with the <hi>Lamb,</hi> shall give <hi>their Testimony</hi> with his <hi>Fathers Name written on their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin then to Argue, that the <hi>Reformation</hi> according to its True Elevation ought to bear, and did bear the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Reformation</hi> in its Fundamental Nature was, and is a disowning, and Ab-Renunciation of the power, and usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and of the pretended <hi>Catholicness</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And even as it was, so it ought to be by some of the <hi>Ten Kings,</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> that had been the defensive <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> that carried that <hi>Mystical Babylonish Woman</hi> and <hi>Whore,</hi> who made the <hi>Kings drunken</hi> with her <hi>Cup of Fornication,</hi> and so they <hi>gave</hi> their <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>Power to Him;</hi> But when their Hearts are turn'd to <hi>Hate the Whore,</hi> They <hi>Renounce the Beast</hi> also: And as it ought, so it did and hath come to pass in several States and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and particularly in these <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> to which we belong.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100645:29"/>
            <p> Now to make out, that this Ab-renunciation ought to bear the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> making an Appearance, Two things according to <hi>Prophecy</hi> are to be remembred.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this last State of the <hi>Roman Monarchy</hi> was compos'd of <hi>Feet,</hi> and <hi>Toes, part of Iron, part of Clay;</hi> that is, of the <hi>Ten</hi> Warlike <hi>Kings;</hi> and a <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of <hi>Cardinals, Archbishops Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> and the <hi>Spiritual Emperour,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> (a <hi>Spirituality</hi> falsly so call'd.) And these Two, the <hi>Iron,</hi> and the <hi>Clay</hi> mingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but do not <hi>cleave;</hi> There is nothing therefore neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to disolve this State, but the dis-union of these Two; or the <hi>Kings hating the Whore,</hi> and so giving no longer the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to the <hi>Beast,</hi> they had <hi>Given;</hi> And this is call'd taking away the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the <hi>Little Horn from Him, Dan.</hi> 2. 42. 43. with <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 26. till it be <hi>Consumed unto the End.</hi> Shewing the thing is done by degrees, first at the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> in a Beginning; then at the end of the 1260 <hi>days,</hi> when the <hi>Witnesses Rise,</hi> and <hi>Ascend;</hi> and by an utter <hi>Aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the <hi>Glorious Appearance of Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There can be nothing between this Renunciation of the <hi>Papacy</hi> and its <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> (when it shall be Universal,) and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> so that whenever the first is, the Last must Immediately Follow, or Enter its Succession: So in <hi>Daniel, c.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. So in this <hi>Prorhecy, c.</hi> 19. If therefore the Renunciation could have been Universal and entire in the <hi>Ten Kings</hi> together; as by Reason of the <hi>Half Time</hi> Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing It could not; It had been impossible the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> should not have succeeded; Seeing then some of the dominion of the <hi>Little Horn</hi> was <hi>taken away</hi> by those of the <hi>Ten Kings</hi> Resuming their <hi>Power,</hi> who had before given it; There were most duely such <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> as ready Immediately to Appear; <hi>viz.</hi> of a Mighty Angel coming down from Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Crying</hi> as with the <hi>Roar of a Lyon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Reformation</hi> was a disengaging, and disencumbring of <hi>Christianity</hi> from the <hi>Abominable Idolatries,</hi> hateful <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Paganish</hi> Ignorance, many practical Impurities of that <hi>Nicolaitanism,</hi> and its <hi>Indulgences;</hi> as also lastly from the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of a sensual, <hi>worldly Grandieur</hi> upon the Account of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> even to that degree, as to turn it into a great <hi>Fable.</hi>

            <p> The <hi>Reformation</hi> was the Illuminating <hi>Christianity</hi> with its own Lustre, with its own native Beauties of Truth, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of worship, Holiness of Action, Spirituality, and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness; and thereby restoring it in some degree to it self, after it had been overgrown with <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> Corruption and <hi>Barbarity.</hi>

            <p>Upon this Account <hi>Seven Thunders</hi> in this <hi>Vision utter'd</hi> their <hi>Voices;</hi> That is, there were mighty Eruptions of Truth, and the sounds of it Heard a far; There were wonderful Purgations of the <hi>Christian Air</hi> from the black vapour, and <hi>Smoke</hi> of the <hi>Bottomless-Pit,</hi> that had darkned it, ever since the first <hi>Letting it out</hi> by the <hi>Key</hi> of that <hi>Fallen Star,</hi> the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state Bishop of Rome:</hi> Such a <hi>Type</hi> as this of the <hi>Thunders</hi> was in the Grace of God an Honour Condigne to the Lightsome, and purer state, or dawn of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> in the <hi>Protestant Churches.</hi>

            <p>Upon this Aceount then in subordination to that higher one of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> Advanc'd so near its <hi>Appearance;</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> was <hi>Held open</hi> in the <hi>Hand</hi> of the <hi>Angel; viz.</hi> that <hi>Book of the Kingdom,</hi> commanded to be <hi>Seal'd, Dan.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>Receiv'd seal'd</hi> from the <hi>Hand</hi> of Him, that <hi>Sate on the Throne</hi> by the <hi>Lamb, Revel.</hi> 5. 7.

            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Reformation</hi> was at the <hi>Half Time</hi> or <hi>Morning</hi> of the <hi>Half day;</hi> There must be then in proportion to the <hi>Rising</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi> the <hi>Third day,</hi> while It was <hi>yet dark,</hi> some motion to the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses;</hi> as we know hath come to pass, in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100645:30"/> the Protection, and Patronage of so many Eminent ministers of Christ; Preachers, and writers under puissant Princes, and States; who have secured them in the publication of the Gospel of Jesus Christ with all the displays of Eloquence, Free Reason, and Admirable Learning in general; and also particularly detecting, and exposing the Frauds, the Cheats, the Impurities, the Irrationalities, the Unlearnednesses, as well as <hi>Antiscripturisms</hi> and <hi>Antichristianisms</hi> of the <hi>Roman Apostacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And They have not been only Secur'd, but set in Honor, and had in Great Veneration, and Esteem; while their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have even <hi>Beheld</hi> it with <hi>Terror,</hi> though so much short of the <hi>Rising</hi> and <hi>Ascension</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> in a <hi>Clou'd,</hi> that shall be.</p>
            <p>And That there should be such a Beginning of the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses Rising,</hi> The <hi>Three days,</hi> and <hi>Half</hi> doe, as <hi>Types</hi> of it Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, as I have shewn, Require; For it is too poor, and private a design for Providence, to Confine so Great Events, as the <hi>Death, Exposal,</hi> and <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> to so Stint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Term, as <hi>Three Years,</hi> and a <hi>Half,</hi> neither more nor Less; only for the sake of Conformity to the Larger spaces of 1260 <hi>days</hi> 42 <hi>Months,</hi> and <hi>Three Times</hi> and a <hi>Half;</hi> Each determin'd to a <hi>Ternary,</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> and a <hi>Half;</hi> And It cannot be suppos'd without a particular designation of <hi>Providence,</hi> so vast, and so narrow spaces, as 1260 <hi>Years,</hi> and but <hi>Three Years</hi> and a <hi>Half</hi> should Chime so Exactly, not only in the <hi>Threes,</hi> but in the <hi>Halfs</hi> also; which would be much below the majesty, both of <hi>Providence</hi> and of <hi>Prophecy</hi> to take care of; But the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Platform is very Great, if Expounded, as I have just now done.</p>
            <p>Further, as if there was an Eye of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> Coming out of their very <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> and that there was an Interruption of that Mournful <hi>Prophecy, John</hi> is Commanded to <hi>Prophecy again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus we have seen the <hi>Light,</hi> or <hi>Bright</hi> side of the <hi>Pillar,</hi> that hath Conducted us so far out of <hi>Spiritual Egypt;</hi> And It calls to mind the Coming of some of the <hi>Captivity</hi> from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon</hi> with an offering of <hi>Gold</hi> to the <hi>House of the Lord,</hi> of which <note place="margin">

               <hi>Crowns</hi> of both the <hi>Royalty,</hi> and of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> to unite in the Great <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> were made, and <hi>set on the Head</hi> of <hi>Joshua,</hi> the <hi>High Priest</hi> of that Time; and the <hi>Crowns</hi> were to Remain, as <hi>Memorials</hi> in the <hi>House of the Lord</hi> to those <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:100645:30"/> though both the <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> and the <hi>Royalty</hi> were in a low Condition, until the coming of <hi>Christ in the Flesh,</hi> and his <hi>Ascention</hi> in the <hi>Spiritual Glory;</hi> and much longer, till the Appearance of both in the <hi>new Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even Thus, The coming of some <hi>Reformed Princes,</hi> and <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> out of <hi>Mystical Babilon</hi> was Honour'd with these <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that Remain as <hi>Memorials</hi> in the <hi>Temple</hi> of this <hi>Prophecy</hi> to them; though the <hi>Kingdom</hi> it self be not in it so much as its <hi>Finiture</hi> for <hi>Glory,</hi> till the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Half Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore still In Relation to that <hi>Half Time</hi> we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to Consider the <hi>Dark side</hi> of the <hi>Pillar,</hi> whose Shade in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Falls especially upon the <hi>Egyptions,</hi> the Resolved Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Antichrist;</hi> and the <hi>mixed Multitude</hi> of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> and those of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> who say, They are <hi>Jews,</hi> and best <hi>Reformed,</hi> but <hi>are not,</hi> but <hi>doe lye;</hi> All which are <hi>Pore-Blind,</hi> and cannot see <hi>afar off,</hi> nor look to the <hi>Glory</hi> that is to be <hi>Reveal'd;</hi> which is to them a <hi>Land</hi> that is <hi>very Far off,</hi> out of their Ken, and Belief: But alass, Even the <hi>Churches</hi> and Servants of Christ are Envelop'd, and Cover'd, and Kept Low; <hi>waiting</hi> for that <hi>Glory,</hi> that is to be <hi>Revealed,</hi> and yet Hidden by the Courseness of the Remaining Time of <hi>Sackcloth;</hi> And they are Themselves too much in the dark by it, as to their own present State, and with regard to the Illustriousness of that which is so near to Ensue, and of which there are Generally so very small Sentiments.</p>
            <p>But indeed, If the Thing were to be Consider'd only in Reason; It could not be Suppos'd, that so Great a work, as the <hi>Reformation</hi> was; if measur'd, and Compar'd with the State of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and that Thick, and Vast Picce of Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; should be left so Imperfect by <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> the Truly <hi>Chief Bishop,</hi> and <hi>Shepard</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> as also the <hi>Prince of the Kings of the Earth,</hi> and more especially, when we duely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the stout Resistance, and Vehement Motion, That <hi>Anti, christian Policy</hi> both in the <hi>Beast,</hi> or <hi>Papacy</hi> it self, as also by the Remainder of the <hi>Ten Kings</hi> hath made to a self Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; the Great Effect of an Impenitency, that is Represented like that of <hi>Pharoahs,</hi> and which is Rais'd up, <hi>made</hi> to <hi>stand up,</hi> as a Rock against God; and that maintins to the Last an <hi>Antitypy</hi> or <hi>Repercussion,</hi> and bold <hi>Resistance</hi> to the very <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Vials</hi> power'd out; and therefore may well be understood
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100645:31"/> to Resist the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> did <hi>Moses</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Plagues</hi> themselves, that Follow'd:</p>
            <p>But what Reason then have we to expect, that God will not give over, till he hath <hi>Cast that Beast</hi> and its <hi>Rider</hi> into the <hi>Red Sea</hi> of the <hi>Everlasting Burnings;</hi> and till <hi>Babilon</hi> and the <hi>Papacy</hi> that carries her, sink as a <hi>Stone,</hi> and as <hi>Lead</hi> into the <hi>Lake of Fire?</hi> and till He also bring his Servants of the <hi>Reformation</hi> into that purity, and perfection of it, to sing the <hi>Song of Moses</hi> and <hi>of the Lamb,</hi> and to behold the <hi>Temple of the Tabernacle of Testimony Open'd</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet in the mean Time, and for that little Remaining space of the 180 <hi>Days,</hi> or <hi>Half Time</hi> and <hi>day,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is our Duty to Humble our selves to behold the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> as It Bears the <hi>Types</hi> of <hi>the Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>Estoppage</hi> according to this <hi>Vision.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because, This is a very Nice, and Tender point, and I am most sensible of it; Least I should <hi>Offend</hi> against the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of The Righteous,</hi> while yet I present the truth of things agreeable with the <hi>Divine-Oracles;</hi> and with a due Regard to the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> Assur'd to us; I will heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; 1. Lay down together; as in a Table the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in <hi>Estoppage,</hi> as they are found in this <hi>Vision:</hi> 2. I will search out for a Correspondent Representation of the <hi>Reformation</hi> in the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Churches;</hi> haveing first Argued It ought to be so done: 3. I will Endeaver to Argue both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this <hi>Vision,</hi> and according to the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Churches,</hi> that the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> is, even in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> under a <hi>Suspension,</hi> till the End of <hi>Half Time,</hi> and the Fuller <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses;</hi> on which the <hi>Finishing</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> shall Immediately press on: And least as I say I should <hi>Offend against,</hi> or <hi>Condemn the Generation</hi> of <hi>Gods Children,</hi> I will be careful to Ballance the Remaining Vertue of each <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ in Appearance</hi> (which sustains the <hi>Reformation</hi> to be the <hi>Reformation</hi> still; notwithstanding that <hi>Estoppage)</hi> with the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> in <hi>Estoppage;</hi> and this I will Endeavour in the Arguing on each <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Estoppage,</hi> to doe, that no shade may be without its Light.</p>

            </list>
            <p>And the Arguments I shall Insist upon, are these Two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. If the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> are a First <hi>Tome</hi> of this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> whch Runs along with the After <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> both in Time, and in the Brief Character of each Time, with strict Relation to the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ; Then certainly the <hi>Reformation</hi> that is so peculiar a Concern to the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> and that hath so particular a <hi>Visson,</hi> as hath been Insisted, must have a Resemblance in those <hi>Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Churches</hi> are such a First <hi>Tome,</hi> I very Briefly Argue, Because It is not the Proper Business of this place.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are Two distinct notes prefix'd to Each, that are not Found in the whole <hi>Prophecy</hi> besides. 1. The <hi>Voice of a Trumpet Talking,</hi> or <hi>Speaking</hi> singly, and Solely to the <hi>Atoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyptical Apostle.</hi> 2. His <hi>Being in the Spirit;</hi> Both these we Find first before the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Churches, c.</hi> 1. 10. and so before the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Seald Book, c.</hi> 4. 1. 2. And neither of them are found any more, either together, or so much as single in the whole <hi>Prophecy</hi> after. The Excellent <hi>Mr. Mede</hi> Endevor'd, but very Succeslesly, to have found the <hi>Trumpet</hi> Speaking to <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Vision, c.</hi> 10. 8. and therefore would have Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the words <hi>(as of a Trumpet)</hi> to the Text, that have no shade in it; Reading thus, <hi>And the Voice which I heard from Heaven</hi> as of a <hi>Trumpet again Spoke to me,</hi> and <hi>said, Take the Book, &amp;c.</hi> And if so, There had yet wanted the other note of distinction, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Apostles being in the Spirit;</hi> But indeed his whole Foundation is mistaken. For neither doth the <hi>Book Prophecy</hi> begin here; as shall presently Appear; Nor does the <hi>Voice from Heaven</hi> Refer so far off, but very Close; For the <hi>Voice from Heaven</hi> in <hi>this very</hi> same Vision, <hi>c</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 4. Bid him first Seal the <hi>Thunders;</hi> Then, as of the same design, It again Bids him <hi>Take the Book,</hi> and <hi>Eat it,</hi> v. 8.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:100645:32"/>
            <p> I confess it is wonderful, that that Admirable <hi>Apocalyptic Interpreter,</hi> to whom God gave to see so much, did not see this; But God gives, as he pleases; <hi>Blessed be his name for All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then are the <hi>Two Tomes of Prophecy;</hi> The <hi>Church-Prophecy;</hi> And the <hi>Book-Prophecy,</hi> beginning in the <hi>Seals,</hi> and going on to the end; Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> excellently divin'd at Two <hi>Apocalyptical Tomes,</hi> and one of the <hi>Book-Prophecy;</hi> but did not rightly fix on the Two; missing the first, and misplacing the second.</p>
            <p>Now if these Two, the <hi>Churches</hi> and the <hi>sealed Book</hi> are only Two distinct <hi>Visions,</hi> and not two <hi>Tomes</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> why are these Two peculiar Notes found here, and no where else? And if the <hi>Churches</hi> were not <hi>Prophetic,</hi> why are All the <hi>Prophetic Solemnities</hi> plac'd upon them?</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is great reason, the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> should be <hi>Prophetic;</hi> For seeing the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> is a <hi>General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi> and <hi>Church of the first Born,</hi> and a <hi>Sanctuary cleans'd;</hi> And also a Church enfolded in a <hi>Dominion given under the whole Heaven;</hi> There is Reason, so great a <hi>Prophecy</hi> should have <hi>Types</hi> suitable to each; So that the first <hi>Tome</hi> is strictly the <hi>Prophecy of the Kingdom,</hi> under the <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> separately; and the latter is the <hi>Book Prophecy</hi> of the State of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> under the <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Empire,</hi> but always Inclusive of the State of his <hi>Church</hi> within it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. The Agreement betwixt the <hi>Symbols</hi> of some of the <hi>Churches,</hi> and of the <hi>Reformation</hi> in this <hi>Visiom</hi> so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable as we shall find Argues a Parallel.</p>
            <p>If then the <hi>Churches</hi> run along with the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> They are to be distributed into these four Classes, or Ranks of Time.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Before the <hi>Apostasie,</hi> and <hi>Beastian Kingdom;</hi> And those <hi>Churches</hi> are <hi>Ephesus,</hi> 1. As in its pure <hi>Apostolic</hi> State, when the <hi>Voice</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> was as <hi>Thunder</hi> in the <hi>Opening</hi> of the <hi>First seal:</hi> 2. As Gradually it <hi>Lost</hi> its first <hi>Love,</hi> by the <hi>First workings</hi> of the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Church of Smyrna,</hi> when it summ'd up the <hi>Christian Martyrdoms</hi> under the <hi>Pagan Emperors,</hi> and then receiv▪d the <hi>Crown of Life</hi> in an <hi>Emblem</hi> under the <hi>Christian Empire;</hi> but all its Time the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> was Rising to a more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative <hi>Synagogue of Sathan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100645:32"/> 2. The <hi>Churches</hi> under the <hi>Apostasie,</hi> or the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses; Pergamus,</hi> under the entire Night-piece of the <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Two Times</hi> of the <hi>Beastian Kingdom;</hi> or of <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac</hi> the <hi>Beast,</hi> and his <hi>Hierarchy</hi> the <hi>False Prophet,</hi> and the <hi>Ten Kings;</hi> when the true <hi>Church</hi> could not make a Separation, but <hi>Had Them of Balam:</hi> And <hi>Thyatyra,</hi> that is under a necessity to <hi>suffer</hi> the <hi>Jezebelian Idolatrous Church,</hi> because of the <hi>Potish Princes</hi> to this very day, ruling over them, and too often with great <hi>Tyranny;</hi> and so shall continue more, or less till the end of the 1260 <hi>days,</hi> or <hi>Time,</hi> even <hi>Half Time,</hi> be in Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute sense no more, but the <hi>Witnesses</hi> fully <hi>Rise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Churches</hi> under the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> where the <hi>Princes</hi> have Renunciated to the <hi>Beast,</hi> and his Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pataion. And they are <hi>Sardis,</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia; Philadelphia</hi> first in a low state, when it hath small strength; and many would shut its <hi>door</hi> that Christ had <hi>set open</hi> to it, before the Succession of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> and then the Higher state of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> when <hi>They of the Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Sathan</hi> shall <hi>worship</hi> at its <hi>Feet;</hi> that is, all <hi>Churches</hi> shall fall into Union with it; and the <hi>New Jerusalem comes down upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Laodicea</hi> is Admirably Adjusted to the <hi>Little Time</hi> of <hi>Sathan Loos'd,</hi> as were it not out of the proper Bounds of this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and so of this discourse, reaching onely to the <hi>Thousand Years,</hi> might be made out.</p>
            <p>And thus far I have laid the general Ground-work of discourse on the <hi>Types,</hi> from which we are to judge of the <hi>Suspension</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> during this low state of the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come therefore in the third place to argue upon this Foundation the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> in a <hi>Suspension.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. I Argue first from the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Angels</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, as if the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> was just then breaking out in <hi>Glory;</hi> But it is most evident, that these <hi>Types</hi> are not <hi>Types,</hi> that imported a <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> in any more then a pre-appearance in this <hi>Vision;</hi> This is most express in <hi>Prophecy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this <hi>Vision</hi> is plainly before the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> as I have beyond Contradiction prov'd from the Notes of <hi>Estop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page</hi> of <hi>Finishing,</hi> which is to be in the days of that <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet;</hi> But it is the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> in which the <hi>Succession</hi> is proclaim'd; Then it is <hi>c.</hi> 11. 15. that there are heard <hi>Loud</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:100645:33"/>
               <hi>Voices</hi> in <hi>Heaven, Saying,</hi> The <hi>Kingdoms of this World are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Kingdoms</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>of his Christ;</hi> and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Types</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> are therefore <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as it shall be in the <hi>days of the Seventh Trumpet,</hi> not as now in the <hi>Reformation:</hi> These <hi>Types</hi> therefore wait the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> for their Complement, and are not yet come into Act, and Life; How then stands the <hi>Estoppage?</hi> Why, we are to consider, what it is, the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> hath its <hi>Succession</hi> to; and as hath been already declar'd; It is to the <hi>Feet of Iron</hi> and to the <hi>Feet of Clay,</hi> or to the <hi>Ten war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Kings,</hi> and to the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and its <hi>Hierarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the first, the <hi>Feet of Iron;</hi> The <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ hath certainly yet had no Succession, where the <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>States</hi> have not yet withdrawn their <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> from the <hi>Beast:</hi> But under all such <hi>Powers</hi> according to the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Thyatyra</hi> is forc▪d to <hi>suffer Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel,</hi> and is therefore so highly commended for its <hi>Service,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> or <hi>Suffering,</hi> as well as <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> and while it is reprov'd in a <hi>Type</hi> for <hi>suffering Jezebel,</hi> yet the Fate of that <hi>Idolatrous Queen,</hi> (if I may so speak) is related to it; And it hath no <hi>other Burden put upon it</hi> but to <hi>Hold fast,</hi> till <hi>Christ comes</hi> in his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and its <hi>Last works</hi> are Foretold to be <hi>Greater,</hi> then the <hi>First; viz.</hi> in the <hi>First Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</hi> That it shall with Christ <hi>Rule</hi> the <hi>Nations</hi> with a <hi>Rod of Iron,</hi> and see the <hi>Morning star</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no wonder therefore, that so many of the Servants of Christ have been under so great <hi>Tyranny;</hi> as not long since in <hi>Hungary,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in the <hi>Savoy</hi> yet continuing; in <hi>Ireland</hi> heretofore; and now, under the Inquisition in <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and other places: Thus <hi>It ought to be</hi> more or less, that <hi>Prophecy</hi> might be <hi>Fulfill▪d;</hi> until the <hi>Witnesses</hi> fully <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,</hi> and the <hi>Tenth,</hi> the <hi>Hicrolyphic</hi> of the <hi>Great City,</hi> fall by the rest of the <hi>Ten Kings</hi> falling <hi>off from it,</hi> But yet from them, we are now to expect <hi>Greater works</hi> for the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> then even those, when <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> with them first flung off the Yoke of <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In those Kingdoms, Nations, and States where the <hi>Whore</hi> is <hi>Hated;</hi> It must with all Reverence, Honour, Fear and duty <hi>to the Supreme</hi> and <hi>Subordinate Powers</hi> over them, as <hi>Beloved,</hi> and <hi>Partakers of the Benefit</hi> be yet Acknowledg'd;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100645:33"/> The <hi>Glory of Christ</hi> does not shine out in their <hi>Government,</hi> as It shall do at the end of <hi>Half Time; All Men now seek their own,</hi> and not the <hi>Things of Jesus Christ;</hi> The <hi>Philadelphian</hi> State most valewed by Christ hath <hi>little strength</hi> from them; that is, only so far, as they with it are separated from <hi>Rome;</hi> But at the <hi>Half Time</hi> ended and in the Succession of <hi>Christ Kingdom,</hi> Even <hi>Princes,</hi> their <hi>Nobles, Chief Counsellers</hi> and <hi>Ministers of State</hi> shall <hi>seek to Christ,</hi> as their <hi>Sovereign Lord;</hi> and in <hi>Spirit</hi> as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did <hi>his Son,</hi> Call him <hi>Lord,</hi> and not only at the Low Rate of present profession; The power <hi>of Christianity</hi> shall be the Highest <hi>Loyalty,</hi> Honor, and Interest.</p>
            <p>But now in Ballance to this, and to give the Light with the shade; As when the <hi>Manly Birth</hi> was Caught up to the <hi>Throne of God,</hi> The <hi>Name of Christ</hi> became <hi>Imperial,</hi> and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wrap'd up in <hi>Antichristianism</hi> could never, shall never be depos'd; so in the <hi>Protestant Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>States</hi> Repriz'd from <hi>Antichrist,</hi> There shall be no Reversal of those <hi>Royal Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi> in this <hi>Vision.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I am most Assur'd, Our late <hi>King James stumbled</hi> at this Rock of <hi>Offence, viz.</hi> A design of Refunding his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> to the <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st,</hi> which had so often Avowed their <hi>Princes under God, and Christ, Supreme Governors;</hi> and on which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Types</hi> of this <hi>Vision, Christ</hi> had in Token of his Right set his <hi>Right</hi> and his <hi>Lest Foot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Intentions therefore made so manifest by that <hi>Crowned Head,</hi> so contrary to this <hi>Appearing Kingdom of Christ</hi> were so vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as by an Immediate Hand from Heaven; as we have seen; In which Light of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> It were much to be desir'd, All the <hi>Conscientiously</hi> dissatisfied might behold the present <hi>Juncture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet all this notwithstanding, It is Evident; The <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ</hi> is in Abatement, even in Relation to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Powers;</hi> For were but one of them Inspir▪d with that very Magnanimity, where with the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> in its <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> shall Inform them All; He would be as <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> as an <hi>Angel of God,</hi> so that all the <hi>Popish</hi> Force in the World should not be able to stand before him: But It is the want of the truly <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Spirit, and an Eye to him, that hath the <hi>Key of David,</hi> that keeps the <hi>Reformed</hi> States Low: So much of the <hi>Sardian</hi> Glory, of this Worlds policy, and small Regard to the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> Hangs yet upon them; yet even this shade hath its Light, in order to that Glory that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100645:34"/> is to come; There are <hi>Ʋndefiled Names</hi> in <hi>Sardis,</hi> that shall <hi>walk with Christ</hi> in <hi>White</hi> with those <hi>Armies</hi> of <hi>Heaven;</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are yet but Low; And especially the <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian</hi> State is drawing near, when the more defiled State of <hi>Sardianism</hi> shall be <hi>Reformed</hi> also.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Second part of the <hi>Beastian Kingdom,</hi> to which the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> is to succeed; and that is, the <hi>Feet of Clay;</hi> the <hi>Cadinals</hi> and other parts of the <hi>Roman Hierarchy,</hi> or the <hi>False Prophetism;</hi> the <hi>Falsly call'd Spiritual Powers,</hi> undivided from the <hi>Beast,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual Emperor,</hi> or <hi>Caesar</hi> in <hi>an Image;</hi> For the making of which <hi>Image</hi> by the <hi>Inhabitants of the Earth,</hi> the <hi>other Beast,</hi> who is also the <hi>False Prophet, wrought Miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> the <hi>Grand Beast:</hi> as Appears by <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with <hi>Revil.</hi> 19. 20.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Hierarchy</hi> is; being <hi>Interpreted,</hi> or by <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Holy Rule,</hi> or <hi>Dominion</hi> deriv'd from, and of the same nature, and <hi>Blasphemous</hi> Cognomination, as his <hi>Holiness</hi> the <hi>Pope;</hi> And we know, the <hi>Reformation</hi> hath not yet brought forth the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> in <hi>Succession;</hi> Because This <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy</hi> hath place in so many of the <hi>Ten Kingdoms</hi> at this day, and is puting in practice the <hi>Depths of Satan</hi> in his now <hi>Ancient Kingdom</hi> against <hi>Thyatyra,</hi> or the <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Popish Princes;</hi> and as far further as it can Reach in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Blessed be God, (which Inlightens this shade) we have seen the <hi>Counsels</hi> of them, who <hi>work</hi> so <hi>deep</hi> as it were, to <hi>hide them</hi> from the <hi>Lord, Esteem'd</hi> as the <hi>Potters Clay,</hi> easily turn'd into another Mould; And so it shall be, till the <hi>Beast,</hi> and his <hi>False Prophet</hi> the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> are <hi>taken,</hi> and <hi>Cast into the Lake</hi> together.</p>
            <p>But we must further yet examine, how far even the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church-Power,</hi> or <hi>Holy Rule</hi> is in Abatement of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ;</hi> and that even in regard of that, It plainly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, It cannot be yet in Succession.</p>
            <p>Now this Point of discourse will, I foresee, lanch immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into a deep Consideration of the <hi>Prophetic Figures</hi> of the <hi>Churches,</hi> and so into the present State of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> under the <hi>Princes of the Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here especially therefore, I would be most tender, and cautious of <hi>Offending</hi> against any of the <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;</hi> I will therefore keep most close to the <hi>Symbols</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy;</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:100645:34"/> and by laying them together, or comparing <hi>Spiritual Things</hi> with <hi>Spiritual,</hi> endeavour to find the just <hi>Standard</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuary;</hi> without set Aplication to any particular Orders, or <hi>Names of Men,</hi> as the <hi>Prophecy</hi> speaks; But where the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication will seem obvious of it self; I must Humbly, and Earnestly Beg, Respect may be had to the Duct and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and not to the mean and unworthy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positor; who is sincere from all design and Intention of <hi>Offending.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To come then to that, which is Truly the Intention, and design; that is, to find out the mind, and Judgment of <hi>Prophecy</hi> concerning the present state of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> that we may with all Humility compose our selves to what is most Approved by it: These following Remarks are to be duely weigh'd, arising from a Collation of the <hi>Types</hi> of <hi>Estop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> as given in the foregoing Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> makes its way by the <hi>Seven Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi> For immediately, as out of the <hi>Open Book</hi> and the <hi>Cry</hi> of the <hi>Gloriously Appearing Angel, Symbols</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Seven Thunders utter their Voices,</hi> or speak their <hi>Voices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Thunders</hi> had as it were a general, and unform'd sound, and Articulate, and distinct words. For there were the <hi>Voices</hi> of the <hi>Thunders,</hi> and the Things, the <hi>Thunders spake;</hi> which <hi>John</hi> was about to <hi>write,</hi> and was <hi>Commanded not</hi> to <hi>write</hi> but to <hi>Seal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. When the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> was <hi>Estopp'd</hi> in the <hi>Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances;</hi> the first thing that was done by way of <hi>Estoppage,</hi> was the <hi>Sealing of the Thunders;</hi> For the <hi>Book</hi> as <hi>enclos'd,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd into Secresie is Transpos'd out of its order; It was seen <hi>Open</hi> before the <hi>Thunders spake;</hi> But it is enclos'd after the <hi>Thunders seal'd,</hi> and after the <hi>Oath;</hi> Intimating, how long they should be <hi>seal'd;</hi> even till the <hi>days</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Angel sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and then no longer; For then <hi>Finishing</hi> ensued: Now this order teaches us, when the <hi>Book was open,</hi> the Services of the <hi>Thunders</hi> were required; But when the Services of the <hi>Thunders</hi> were <hi>suspended;</hi> The <hi>Book</hi> must have also a Co-Temporary enclosure, and <hi>Prophecy</hi> be continued so long also; as shall after be further clear'd, as to the reason of it, Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally resting in the <hi>Book,</hi> and declaratively (and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially) in the <hi>Thunders seal'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:100645:35"/> 4. The <hi>Thunders</hi> must needs be Reserv'd under their <hi>Seals</hi> till the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> when the <hi>Mystery</hi> or <hi>Kingdom</hi> shall be in <hi>Finishing;</hi> For because the <hi>Kingdom</hi> made an <hi>Appearance,</hi> They <hi>spake,</hi> or <hi>Ʋttered their Voices;</hi> But because <hi>Finishing</hi> should not be till the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> They were <hi>Seal'd;</hi> So their service attends <hi>Finishing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Seeing then, as I have argued, the <hi>Churches</hi> are Co-Temporary, and run along with the whole <hi>Prophecy;</hi> In whatever <hi>Church</hi> State of the <hi>Reformation</hi> we find <hi>Finishing,</hi> there the <hi>Thunders</hi> must have had the fullest effect, when they did <hi>utter their Voices,</hi> though what they distinctly <hi>spake,</hi> was after <hi>seal'd;</hi> and in that <hi>Church state</hi> also they must be <hi>unseal'd,</hi> because there <hi>Finishing</hi> is to be.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> that bears the most clear and evident Characters of <hi>Finishing the Mystery</hi> in the <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary cleans▪d,</hi> and of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> is the <hi>Philadelphian Church;</hi> For that hath a <hi>Door open'd to it</hi> by the <hi>Key of David,</hi> that cannot be <hi>shut:</hi> That hath a <hi>Crown;</hi> That hath above all, the <hi>Names,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>of my God,</hi> and of the <hi>New Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem the City of my God,</hi> that <hi>cometh down from my God out of Heaven,</hi> and <hi>my new Name.</hi> All which we know are found in the ultimate <hi>Finishing of the Mysteuy, c.</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>9. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, the <hi>Overcomers,</hi> of every <hi>Church</hi> have promises deriv'd from the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> state; but none so High and Orient, or so Intimately conjoyn'd with the <hi>Church</hi> state it self, as <hi>Philadelph;</hi> as were it not too long for the present purpose might be made out, though very visible of it self.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Seeing the <hi>Thunders</hi> are so serviceable to the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> The Church of the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the clearest, and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm'd Acceptance with Christ, must have most of the power of the <hi>Thunders.</hi> Now <hi>Thyatyra</hi> is blam'd, tho' only in <hi>Type,</hi> for <hi>suffering Jezebel;</hi> Shewing it was not, nor would be of that Mighty vertue, Elevation and Power as to <hi>cast her</hi> quite out; while oppressed by <hi>Popish Princes;</hi> though it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from it; Because the Time was not yet come, else it had been not a small, but a great thing against it; Its <hi>last works</hi> would yet be greater towards <hi>Jezebels casting out,</hi> then of the first <hi>Reformation;</hi> which <hi>last works</hi> so great are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be expected suddenly from among those <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> though yet they are suffering under <hi>Popish Powers.</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:100645:35"/> And then All <hi>Thyatyra</hi> shall fall into the <hi>Philadelphian Church,</hi> having <hi>held fast,</hi> what it had till the <hi>coming of Christ,</hi> that is till the succession of his <hi>Kingdom:</hi> The Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> is, except in the <hi>undefiled Names</hi> blam'd throughout. The <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphian Church</hi> is alone Illustrated with the un-allayed Commendations of Christ vouchsaf'd to it; That then must have most of the <hi>Thunders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Seeing what words the <hi>Thunders spake were seal'd,</hi> there must needs be a lower, and a higher state, even of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphian Church;</hi> a lower, while the <hi>Thunders words</hi> are <hi>seal'd;</hi> a higher, when they are <hi>unseal'd;</hi> some things therefore in the Character of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> speak it in a state of conflict, <hi>viz.</hi> till the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> and the succession of Christs <hi>Kingdom;</hi> Some things speak it in a state of Exaltation, as in that <hi>Kingdom</hi> in its <hi>Succession;</hi> and as of the <hi>Witnesses rising</hi> on <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and the <hi>Thunders</hi> fully <hi>unseal'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. The <hi>Sardian</hi> so imperfect, or <hi>Faded</hi> state of, and in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> does, as it must, and according to this Frame of things ought, shew, that the <hi>Thunders</hi> did not make the due dint, and Impression upon it, as we shall see.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The Impression of the <hi>Sardian</hi> state, will be best un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by the opposition, it carries to the Graces of the <hi>Philadelphian state,</hi> even now in its Conflict; And so the <hi>unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed Names</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Sardis</hi> may be also understood by their Agreement with the Graces of the <hi>Philadelphian Church;</hi> Because it is so much the Pattern.</p>
            <p n="11">11. These things are strictly, and critically to be applyed to the Church-states, and not to particular persons; but as they are vitally inspir'd by the Truly <hi>Philadelphian</hi> graces; or deeply, and viciously Immers'd in the <hi>Sardian defilements;</hi> For there may be Hypocrites even in the <hi>Philadelphian,</hi> and there may be in the <hi>Sardian Church overcomers,</hi> that surmount the state, wherein they are involv'd, in Holiness, and in the vertues of the <hi>Thunders</hi> upon their Hearts, and Lives, as I may be allowed here to speak.</p>
            <p>For though all these <hi>Types</hi> of <hi>Prophecy</hi> are to be stripp'd out of the <hi>Ciphar,</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> into plain practical Truths, and documents by our Minds; yet in discourses upon them, It is very decent to speak according to the Laws of <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Iconism,</hi> and <hi>Imagery;</hi> as leading to those spiritual senses included in them.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:100645:36"/> 12. The <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> making its way by mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Truth, symbol'd by these <hi>Thunders sounds;</hi> And these <hi>Thunders</hi> having been us'd by God to produce the <hi>Reformed Churches;</hi> and of several Elevations according to the deeper dints, and Impressions, or participation of these <hi>Thunders</hi> in their general, only, or particular distinct sounds; All this having been already lay'd down, it may be very necessary that we may judge the better of the state of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> to consider, and Contemplate these <hi>Thunders</hi> in their most distinct, and Articulate <hi>speakings:</hi> For it is certain, tho' they were <hi>sealed</hi> in this <hi>Vision,</hi> yet they are to be found in a <hi>Vision of this Prophecy</hi> under the <hi>Sevenih Trumpet,</hi> that is to <hi>Finish</hi> to the <hi>Kingdom of Christ in Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further, there are some things in them, that are to be aspir'd to by the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> now; Tho' there are others to be waited and prayed for at the end of the <hi>Half Time,</hi> or at that <hi>Seventh Trumpet;</hi> By a very brief prospect over them as they lye before us, <hi>c.</hi> 14.

            <p>Now in these <hi>Thunders Seald;</hi> It is most Evident, the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ</hi> must be under Suspension; For seeing <hi>Christs Kingdom</hi> mov's not by outward Force, or at least not by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Force Alone, but by the mighty power of Divine Truth; How can it be otherwise, but that while such migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and wonderful Truths, and Concernments of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi>

               <hi>Thunders,</hi> as the <hi>Voice of God</hi> in many mighty Effects.</p>
            <p>Having thus fully Remark'd on the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Thunders,</hi> I now come in the second place in due order to consider the <hi>Church-State</hi> in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> Succeeding the <hi>Feet of Clay;</hi> and that more particularly under <hi>Reformed</hi> Princes, and States; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the second <hi>Type,</hi> joyn'd with the Third; that is, the <hi>Book,</hi> that was <hi>Open</hi> in the <hi>Hand</hi> of the <hi>Angel,</hi> and after Retir'd, and Enclos'd; and thereupon a Commission to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> again; And therein I am to shew, that in it there is a clear Signification; The <hi>Reformation</hi> is but in an Imperfect State, as yet: and that It shall certainly at the End of <hi>Half Time,</hi> be, as it were a new <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi> is therefore diligently to be consider'd; For it is the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom Seal'd</hi> at the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> when <hi>Vision,</hi> and <hi>Prophecy</hi> were <hi>Seal'd:</hi> The <hi>Seales</hi> were Gradually open'd under the <hi>Pagan Emperors</hi> by the <hi>Blood of</hi> the <hi>Lamb,</hi> by the <hi>word of</hi> his <hi>Testimony,</hi> by his <hi>Saints not Loving their Lives unto Death,</hi> as hath been already Discoursed: and the <hi>Seals</hi> were all <hi>Ʋnsealed</hi> in the <hi>Christian Empire,</hi> when the <hi>Kingdom of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r God came</hi> into Appearance. But then the whole Course of the <hi>Six Trumpets,</hi> and of the <hi>Antichristian</hi> State, which were <hi>Lamentation, Mourning,</hi> and <hi>Woe,</hi> were <hi>written</hi> in it, <hi>within,</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> as in <hi>Ezekiels Roll;</hi> All which were to have their Course, before It <hi>Open'd</hi> into the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the Morning of the <hi>Half Time,</hi> There remain'd nothing written, but the Remaining part of the <hi>Witnesses Sackcloth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy;</hi> before the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> would be in Succession by the <hi>Witnesses</hi> Rising, and its Grand Concurrents, at the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> Sounding, when the <hi>Book</hi> would be fully <hi>Open:</hi> So near therefore to the Fulfilling of all things written in the <hi>Book,</hi> and at the Remaining of none of the <hi>Time, Times,</hi> or so much as <hi>Half Time</hi> Entire; The <hi>Angel</hi> had the <hi>Book Open</hi> in his <hi>Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it were out of the <hi>Book,</hi> wherein the <hi>Kingdom</hi> was written, He makes the <hi>Loud Cry</hi> of that his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as the <hi>Lyon of the Tribe of Judah;</hi> and so out of that <hi>Cry</hi> from that <hi>Book,</hi> the <hi>Thunders</hi> derived the things, They spoke in order
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100645:38"/> to that <hi>Kingdom;</hi> The <hi>Kingdom</hi> and the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> being always the same.</p>
            <p>But when the <hi>Thunders words,</hi> as they are call'd, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 9. and in this <hi>Prophecy</hi> (The things which they <hi>spake)</hi> were Commanded to be <hi>Seal'd;</hi> which was the first stay of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> after this its Appearance; And when the <hi>Angel</hi> had <hi>Sworn</hi> the utmost Time of this <hi>Estoppage viz.</hi> Till the <hi>Seventh Trumpet;</hi> Then the <hi>Book</hi> it self, from whence the <hi>Thunders</hi> were taken by the Mediation of the <hi>Angels Cry,</hi> was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Secrecy also; And this Secrecy was the <hi>Belly</hi> of the <hi>Prophet;</hi> And a Commission was given to <hi>Prophecy again,</hi> with this Express signification; <hi>John</hi> sustaining the person of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> whose History of whole <hi>Prophecy</hi> for 1260 <hi>days</hi> Immediatly Ensu'd, <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>Prophecy</hi> again; <hi>viz.</hi> In regard of the Remaining part of the 1260 <hi>days,</hi> or <hi>Half Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so this was to signifie; The Time of the delay of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> was during the Remainder of the <hi>Witnesses Prophecy,</hi> and so during the Remainder of the 1260 <hi>days;</hi> and so the <hi>Book</hi> Conceal'd, and <hi>Prophecy</hi> out of, or according to it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue together, till they <hi>Open</hi> in the <hi>Witnesses Rising,</hi> and <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> just before the <hi>Seventh Trumpet;</hi> And then the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> is in its <hi>Succession,</hi> so <hi>Prophecy</hi> ceases in <hi>Finishing;</hi> and the <hi>Book of the Kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> open together by the <hi>Witnesses</hi> open and <hi>Ʋnsealed Testimony,</hi> and Ministration of the <hi>Thunders Ʋnsealed</hi> also; when the 144000 Appear with the <hi>Lamb</hi> on <hi>Mount Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the true History of the <hi>Sealed Book,</hi> become as in Symbol a <hi>Little Book</hi> in this <hi>Vision,</hi> by so much being Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd; which <hi>Book</hi> in the <hi>Seals</hi> of it, in the things <hi>writen</hi> in it, <hi>within,</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> are of the same measure with the whole <hi>Apocelyptick Prophecy;</hi> But the <hi>Kingdom</hi> being so <hi>near</hi> at the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> it was <hi>held Open,</hi> and then Enclos'd; At the <hi>Succession</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> It shall be fully <hi>Open,</hi> and so lye <hi>Open</hi> for Ever.</p>
            <p>And thus there is indeed the <hi>Book Prophecy</hi> distinct from the <hi>Church Prophecy;</hi> But it must needs begin at the <hi>Seals;</hi> For the <hi>Opened Seals</hi> were Essential to the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> so to the <hi>Book of the Kingdom,</hi> and so to the <hi>Prophecy of the Kingdom</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Book:</hi> And there can be no difference between the <hi>Book; c.</hi> 5. and <hi>c.</hi> 10. Except its being call'd a <hi>Little Book,</hi> which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100645:38"/> is no difference, but most Agreeable to the <hi>Symbol</hi> of so much of it <hi>Fulfil'd,</hi> as was just now noted; So the Remainer was Little.</p>
            <p>Now that which will Redound to us from this <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Book Open,</hi> and then Enclos'd, as in Relation to the Kingdom of Christ; is.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there was a necessity of the <hi>Sealing</hi> the <hi>Thunders;</hi> For such mighty <hi>powers</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> to <hi>come,</hi> in the display of themselves, must needs have brought forth the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> which is the <hi>World to come;</hi> If they had not been <hi>Seal'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because, there was yet so much <hi>written in the Book</hi> to be Accomplish'd in order to that <hi>Kingdom;</hi> The <hi>Book</hi> could not be <hi>Open'd,</hi> as Fulfil'd in that Grand Effect. But it was still to be committed to <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as was Figur'd by the <hi>Prophets Eating</hi> it, and finding it <hi>Bitter</hi> in his <hi>Belly;</hi> Therefore the <hi>Thunders</hi> must needs be <hi>Seal'd</hi> for that Time also.</p>
            <p>Hence it follows; This state of the <hi>Reformation</hi> cannot be the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> in its <hi>Succession,</hi> nor can be Capable of the High Actuation of the <hi>powers</hi> of it; The <hi>Thunders</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in their Operation, or at work, because the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> cannot yet <hi>come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Those <hi>Witnesses</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Thyatyra,</hi> or of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches</hi> under the <hi>Popish Princes,</hi> yet united with the <hi>Feet of Clay,</hi> cannot but be in <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> and not <hi>Risen;</hi> For the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> hath no Appearance of Succession there; Though in those <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> mighty powers of the <hi>Thunders</hi> first <hi>Speaking</hi> still <hi>shew forth themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what the <hi>Thunders</hi> then spake, hath been ever since so Seal'd, and shall be; That they cannot prevail, as they did at the first <hi>Reformation;</hi> But as if the <hi>Thunders</hi> were to open again first among them; Their <hi>last works</hi> are to be expected Greater than <hi>the First,</hi> as Christ hath Fore-tol'd: As yet then they are under a necessity to <hi>suffer Jezebel,</hi> whch they shall not then be. All which hath been before Intimated, but is hereby in this Reason of it further Explain'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There cannot be even in the best <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> and under the most <hi>Reform'd</hi> Prince, Princes, or States, such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as should bring the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ into a <hi>Succession</hi> among them; For if it were so in Succession in one place, It would Immediatly spread every where; whereby we know, It is not so in Succession any where;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100645:39"/> And because the <hi>Book</hi> is so enclos'd, as not <hi>Fulfil'd,</hi> and the <hi>Thunders</hi> thereupon <hi>Seal'd,</hi> we know, it cannot be so.</p>
            <p n="4">4. So much of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> as appears in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> or of the Enjoyment of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> is to all the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ, as the <hi>Book sweet</hi> in the <hi>Mouth;</hi> But what is wanting, is as the <hi>Book bitter in the Belly;</hi> whether in Regard of Remaining Darkness, and Impurity; or in Regard of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffliction, and Remaining <hi>Sackcloth;</hi> All which causes a High Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew, of what they enjoy; And earnest Faith, Hope, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for what they want, are in Action.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By way of Allusion, It may be added; The <hi>Book Hidden</hi> in the <hi>Prophets Belly</hi> shews, how little <hi>Prophecy</hi> would be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, during the <hi>Sealed Thunders;</hi> And that those whom God Enclines, and Enables to <hi>Read,</hi> find a <hi>Sweetness</hi> in the <hi>Mouth,</hi> or in declaring, what they have found; But in regard of the unwelcome Reception by <hi>Hearers,</hi> It <hi>Returs,</hi> as not well En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd, with <hi>Bitterness</hi> into their <hi>own Bosomes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I offer this only by way of Allusion; For the second <hi>Thunder,</hi> first speaking and then <hi>Seal'd,</hi> gives the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Reason; why <hi>Prophecy</hi> is either so well, or no better <hi>Read,</hi> or <hi>Heard;</hi> Even because, that <hi>Thunder</hi> did <hi>speak,</hi> there hath been since the <hi>Reformation</hi> all along, some light Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of it; But it is no greater a light; Because That new <hi>Mission</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> of that Excellent order of the <hi>Everlasting Gospel,</hi> is not yet gone out, or the <hi>Book open</hi> in the <hi>Succession</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> All which shallcome to pass in its own Season, and that very shortly, to Inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en this shade.</p>
            <p>And so I come to the last point of Judgment upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> by its <hi>Types, viz.</hi> By an Inspection into the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> under <hi>Reformed Princes</hi> also; which as I have before laid down, are <hi>Sardi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> and <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia;</hi> wherein it will appear the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> is under Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension and Estoppage, even by the compare of these Two <hi>Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now It is most Evident by this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and by all other <hi>Prophecy;</hi> The <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> consists in two things, 1. All Purity, Holyness; Spirituality, Heavenlyness, as the Intrinsick, or inward Form, Spirit, and Constitution of it; and 2. In an Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Appearance of Happiness, peace, and Visible Greatness, and Excellency, as the outward Attendant Glory. If then,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100645:39"/> and so long as these two stand divided; and that there is the greatest outward Appearance of power and Lustre, where there is least of Inward purity, and Spirituallity; and most In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward purity, and Spirituality, where there is least outward power and Lustre; So long we may know, the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> is under a Suspension, and Abatement; Even although It hath made some Appearance.</p>
            <p>Thus It was during the <hi>Pagan Empire;</hi> There were High measures of purity, and of the power of the Gospel, but then the outward Appearance was dark, Gloomy, and under suffering, and Persecution; The <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> is therefore Represented under <hi>Seals.</hi> And till those <hi>Seals</hi> were <hi>Open'd,</hi> It could not Appear.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Christian Empire,</hi> the <hi>Seals</hi> were <hi>Opened,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> having an outward Glory in that <hi>Imperial State,</hi> and the <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> not yet Risen to a <hi>Throne;</hi> The <hi>Kingdam of our God</hi> is said to be <hi>Come, viz.</hi> only in an <hi>Emblem</hi> of it self; not as it then was, but as it shall Come; But because the <hi>Apostacy</hi> was now Risen to a <hi>Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> and that the <hi>Church</hi> was taking its <hi>Flight</hi> into the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> therefore the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> was under an <hi>Estoppage</hi> for <hi>Twelve Hundred</hi> and <hi>Sixty Days;</hi> and <hi>Antichrist</hi> surpriz'd the outward Glory (so far as it Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd) without the purity, and Spirituality; And so <hi>Ecclips'd</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> by his foul Corruptions of <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> there being an Appearance of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> in the power of Truth, breaking out by the <hi>Thunders;</hi> and the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Reformatlon</hi> Giving some degrees of outward Glory, and peace to it; tho' far below, what shall shine outwith the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> it self; we shall find by these two <hi>Churches Types,</hi> how the <hi>Estoppage</hi> arises; The Supreme, and Infinitely holy Cause is; That Jesus Christ will not bring forth his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> till the full end of <hi>Half Time,</hi> and till all <hi>written</hi> in the <hi>Book</hi> be Accomplish'd for it; But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, or sinful Cause is to be found in the <hi>Churches</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; that is, as not prepar'd, nor rising high enough in the power of Truth: as in <hi>Thyatyra,</hi> or the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> under <hi>Popish Princes,</hi> it was a <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Infirmity</hi> to suffer <hi>Jezebel;</hi> and under <hi>Reformed Princes,</hi> there is a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> that loose the high Spirit of the <hi>Thunders</hi> in the <hi>Reformation;</hi> a sin of a much higher degree, and therefore not call▪d, a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100645:40"/>
               <hi>Little Thing;</hi> yet that Christ will <hi>visit</hi> in the mercy of a further <hi>Reformation,</hi> and not in wrath, as upon the <hi>Apostasie,</hi> as we shall see presently.</p>
            <p>And these two so different Causes concurring, we may plainly see, how the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> is stay'd from its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Even when the <hi>Princes,</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> are both <hi>Reform'd:</hi> For <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that hath evidently the greatest <hi>Symbols</hi> of <hi>Purity,</hi> and of the power of Truth, and so of the <hi>Thunders,</hi> hath least of outward glory, and peace; For it hath least <hi>strength</hi> or Protection from <hi>Princes;</hi> and there appears a <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,</hi> tho' not a <hi>Throne of Sathan,</hi> that would shut its <hi>door,</hi> that Christ had <hi>open'd</hi> to it; And it <hi>keeps the word of Christs pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> shewing, it is in a low and depress'd estate, even as the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> yet is, in the world.</p>
            <p>On the other side <hi>Sardi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> that had least of the power of Truth, had most of outward Glory. And to make this the more Apparent, it is added in <hi>Sardis;</hi> The <hi>Ʋndefiled Names</hi> in it were, not only <hi>Few,</hi> but <hi>Small,</hi> as the word Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</p>
            <p>Here then is the state of the <hi>Suspension</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ in the <hi>Reformation;</hi> Either there is more of the power of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> as in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and the <hi>Ʋndefiled names of Sardis,</hi> and less of outward <hi>splendor,</hi> and <hi>strength;</hi> through disinclination of <hi>Reformed Princes,</hi> very low in the truly <hi>Philadelphian Spirit,</hi> and too prone to the <hi>Sardian;</hi> Or there is more of outward Splendor and strength, but less of the power of Truth, and purity by having <hi>Forgotten</hi> the things, the <hi>Thunders spake</hi> at the first <hi>Reformation,</hi> as in <hi>Sardis:</hi> and either way there must be a stop upon the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> which consists in the <hi>Abundance</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and of <hi>Glory,</hi> Psal. 85. 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then set these Two <hi>Churches,</hi> as in the the <hi>Types</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven here by <hi>Prophecy,</hi> in Parallels opposite one to the other; and then let us in our minds compare them with the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> we know by experience now in the world; and after argue by reason upon them, that we may know, what keeps the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ under <hi>Estop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,</hi> as it is to succeed the <hi>Feet</hi> of <hi>Clay,</hi> or the <hi>Antichristian Hierarchy.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. When we find two <hi>Typical Churches</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and under <hi>Reformed Princes</hi> also, of two very different Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in the <hi>Reformation;</hi> and the state of one <hi>Symboll▪d</hi> to be that, on which the <hi>new Jerusalem</hi> is to <hi>Come down;</hi> and the other very Imperfect; and not only so, but even declin'd in the Principles, and Action of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as it tends to the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> All which we have seen in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels; we are then to consider what it is in the first place, that Interposes against that <hi>Church,</hi> that hath the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the <hi>Reformation</hi> so high, that the new <hi>Jerusalem comes down upon it,</hi> so that it cannot yet appear like to it self; And whatever Interposes against that, we have reason to think, It keeps the other <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> so Low, as it is here describ'd.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The great wisdom therefore of <hi>Prophecy</hi> is; Besides that it would cast a vail on <hi>Sardis,</hi> as a Church of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and not charge a <hi>Synagogue of Satan,</hi> upon it downright, the reason before given; Besides this, I say, the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> is in the wisdom of <hi>Prophecy</hi> most fitly placed in that <hi>Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church,</hi> that is so every way fitted to receive the <hi>new Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi> to shew, why the <hi>new Jerusalem</hi> did not <hi>come down</hi> upon it Immediatly; The <hi>Synagogue of Satan</hi> is therefore Figur'd, as in the midst of that <hi>Church,</hi> not as of it, but as withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Power, Efficacy, and Glory.</p>
               <p>From all this It then Appears; On what Culpable, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient or sinful cause; The <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> did not, and does not yet Appear in the <hi>Resormation:</hi> But the <hi>Thunders</hi> and their mighty powers of Truth have been, and yet are <hi>Seald;</hi> Even because, as in the <hi>Christian Empire,</hi> when the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> was ready to Appear in Glory, and the <hi>Kingdom of our God to come;</hi> The <hi>Antichristian Apostacy</hi> surpriz'd it; Even thus, when the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> was ready to <hi>Appear</hi> in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</hi> the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> by some, that too much Favour'd it, and would Redivive, or Return it on the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> was as a great dark Cloud, falling upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> and obscuring it, and so stay'd the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> from being in its <hi>Succession.</hi>

               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:100645:42"/>
               <p> Our next great Enquiry therefore must be Concerning the <hi>Synagogue of Satan,</hi> what it is; and who they are, that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to it, and yet are not call▪d expresly, the <hi>Synagogue</hi> it self; and how this <hi>Synagogue</hi> stops the Succession of Christ's <hi>Kingdom,</hi> particularly with respect to the <hi>Feet of Clay;</hi> how it Gauges the <hi>Sardian Church,</hi> and surprizes the strength of Great <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Magistrates</hi> from running in a full stream into the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Channel; So that the <hi>small Names</hi> in <hi>Sardis</hi> are of themselves, and alone not potent enough to Erect the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Frame; Although they are so clear in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as that they, and the <hi>Churches</hi> under them, have not <hi>defiled their Garments,</hi> as <hi>Sardis</hi> in general hath done.</p>
               <p>That I may then find out the sense of <hi>Prophecy</hi> in this <hi>Synagogue of Sathan</hi> in all these things, I must consider it.</p>
               <list>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>This <hi>Synagogue,</hi> as it stood in the days of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Smyrna;</hi> I account from the <hi>Memories</hi> of the <hi>Dioclesian Martyrs</hi> to the very days of the <hi>Apostasie</hi> rising to a <hi>Throne,</hi> or the beginning of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> 1260 days; when the <hi>Beastian</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple first came into the <hi>outward Court,</hi> in order to erect him a <hi>Throne</hi> in that <hi>outward Court,</hi> call▪d often the <hi>Temple;</hi> that the <hi>Man of sin</hi> might, as the Apostle <hi>Paul prophesied</hi> of him, <hi>sit in it</hi>

               <p>I come therefore to the third Thing, the <hi>Prophetical symbol</hi> of this <hi>Synagogue</hi> in the <hi>Church of Philadelphia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Synagogue of Sathan</hi> in the <hi>Church of Philadelphia</hi> arose on this wise; Some of first <hi>Reformers</hi> observed, that the <hi>Antichristian Apostasie</hi> had since the Time of the <hi>Four first Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels</hi> (as they speak) Amassed, and heap'd up corruptions, and foulest pollutions in <hi>doctrine, worship,</hi> and their <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chic Government,</hi> as well as in matters of practice; which in the Language of <hi>Prophecy</hi> was superstructing, or setting a <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Sathan</hi> upon the <hi>Synagogue of Sathan;</hi> and fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Throne of Sathan</hi> into an <hi>Ancient Kingdom</hi> by those <hi>Hellish Pollicies,</hi> applyed to all purposes; which the <hi>Prophecy</hi> calls <hi>depths of Sathan,</hi> as it were the Arcana Imperii, or the <hi>Cabals of the Conclave:</hi> Those first <hi>Reformers,</hi> either out of Prudence, (as they thought) not to remove all at once;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100645:44"/> or being really perswaded of the good state of things in the <hi>Christian Church</hi> so far; There they set the bounds of <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi> It reached so far, and no farther: They then model'd a <hi>Reformation,</hi> at first at least, that should remove all that had entred since that Time, and Left the Rest standing.</p>
               <p>Or if they turn'd out fome courser things, that at least bid very fair for <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> and veneration, though not <hi>worship</hi> of their <hi>Images;</hi> They receiv'd in other things of a finer Thred, though of an after date; especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> and the defiled Springs of Profit, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from thence: Now what the first <hi>Reformers</hi> might pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially contrive, not to do all at once; Their <hi>Posterity</hi> so approv'd, as to coninue to this <hi>day</hi> as a standard for all Ages.</p>
               <p>Thus there remain'd the Loss of the true, close practical, Applicatory methods of <hi>Preaching,</hi> and Prayer according to the most concernful Points of the Interest of Consciences; both as to matter and manner given us in <hi>Scripture;</hi> There remain'd <hi>Liturgies</hi> and great Quantities of <hi>Ritualism;</hi> An Exalted state of <hi>Hierarchy</hi> remained in a great Face of Grandieur, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of worldly wealth; very distant from <hi>keeping the Words of Christs Patience;</hi> and locking fast even the <hi>Reform'd</hi> Christian world into a Belief, that the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> is <hi>of this world;</hi> and that a prosperity in it, too often, even to sensuality is an Argument of such a <hi>Kingdom to be enjoyed</hi> here. To these things Others of the <hi>Reformers,</hi> even at first, Remonstrated, and continually Declared against; and were zealous of a through, and perfect <hi>Reformation</hi> according to the <hi>word of God;</hi> Accounting nothing <hi>Primitive,</hi> under any Pretension of being the practice of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or <hi>Ancient Christians;</hi> if not to be made out by clear and evident as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances from thence; And a Generation of such <hi>Reformed,</hi> have sprung from them, and risen higher and higher to this very <hi>day,</hi> as a <hi>Philadelphian Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon from the very first, and so on to this Time, There hath been a Cleft in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> Earnest Endeavours were to Reduce this latter sort of <hi>Reformers</hi> by Arguments, by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reflexions upon them, as <hi>Schismatics;</hi> and where these would not prevail by <hi>Censures, Suspensions,</hi> and <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> all proper to a <hi>Synagogue;</hi> Now in all these things It could not be Avoided, but that the <hi>Civil Reformed powers</hi> must
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100645:45"/> be Concern'd; And so it hath hitherto been, that the First sort of <hi>Reformers</hi> have had the greatest favour, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; and the Latter fallen under displeasure, as <hi>Factious, Turbulent,</hi> and even <hi>Rebellions,</hi> a sort of men, odd, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, <hi>Troublers</hi> of <hi>States,</hi> and <hi>Enemies of Kings;</hi> So the Former were by <hi>Law Establish'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Except some of the Lower and less <hi>Puissant Protestant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> or <hi>States,</hi> that have espoused, and settled by their Laws, the desires of the Latter sort of <hi>Reformers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things are Notorious <hi>Matters of Fact,</hi> both in the <hi>Lutheran Churches,</hi> and Others; which for honours sake I do not name, but leave to general knowledge, and Recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Now with what ease do all these Things run into the Mould of <hi>Prophecy?</hi> For here is first the <hi>Synagogue of Sathan,</hi> that the <hi>Antichristian Apostasie</hi> hath so far surmounted by its <hi>Throne,</hi> and by its <hi>Depths,</hi> as to make no account at all of as <hi>Catholick,</hi> as they call it; that he who will be a <hi>Catholick</hi> no further, They Damn him as a <hi>Heretick;</hi> and though they Hold it as their own; and it is indeed so far as it went, in the esteem of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> the very propriety of the <hi>Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Apostasie,</hi> and not the Right of so much, as the First sort of <hi>Reformers,</hi> as I shall presently shew.</p>
               <p>But yet this <hi>Synagogue</hi> by that kind of <hi>Reformers</hi> is endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to be vindicated, to be given, as the true Pattern of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> to which All are to Conform, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore argued so earnestly upon by them, to Reduce both <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks</hi> to it; And so it is Rediviv'd; It is brought again upon the stage of Time in all the particulars before named.</p>
               <p>This projects, or casts by its shade a <hi>Sardian Church,</hi> made splendid, and beautiful by the favour of the greatest <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> Princes, and so draws the multitude to it; But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the true principles of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> at which it began, are <hi>Forgotten;</hi> and the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now whoever shall consider, how these known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> Indent with <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and shall due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consider them, can I Think, hardly Believe, but that <hi>Prophecy</hi> was prepar'd for them; or if He can gain of Himself not to think so; Yet He cannot but think, It is very unhappy, or rather, if He favour, what <hi>Prophecy</hi> favours, Happy; Every Thing in Event should find so proper a place, and Reception in the <hi>Symbols of Prophecy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now herein let us behold the Great <hi>Mystery of Prophecy,</hi> and <hi>Divine Providence</hi> in this Last Age, <hi>viz.</hi> Since the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> in bringing Things to pass according to it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reformation</hi> was such an Appearance of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ, that was under a peculiar dispensation, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some such <hi>Symbols</hi> Agreeable, as assur'd it could never be Recall'd.</p>
               <p>And yet the <hi>Antichristian Apostasie</hi> was to have, as much as could be in a consistency with such an <hi>Appearance,</hi> the full Remnant of its <hi>Half Time,</hi> or 42 Months, and the <hi>Witnesses</hi> their <hi>Sackcloth</hi> the Full of the 1260 <hi>Days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now how could These Two Things be Reconciled? Loe then the <hi>Depths</hi> of the <hi>Divine ways,</hi> Testifyed before
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100645:46"/> hand by <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and accordingly brought forth by <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Because the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> Contain'd that full <hi>Half Time</hi> of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and the <hi>Remainder</hi> of the 1260 <hi>Days;</hi> the <hi>Thunders</hi> as mighty Powers of Truth in their <hi>Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Declarations</hi> are stay'd or <hi>Seal'd;</hi> as hath been said; the <hi>Book</hi> is <hi>Enclos'd, Prophecy</hi> continues, and the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> is <hi>Estopp'd,</hi> and the <hi>Church Ecclips'd</hi> partially, even within the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Sathan</hi> observes this Opportunity, and makes the best of it for his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> yet <hi>Resting</hi> to Him. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd his <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Throne</hi> Rebated beyond Recall, and his <hi>Depths</hi> Proclaim'd to be the <hi>Depths of Sathan;</hi> of these He despair'd; But He consider'd, his <hi>Synagogue</hi> was Fram'd, during the <hi>Christian Empire,</hi> before the <hi>Apostasie</hi> entred with its Thick, and Foul Corruptions; that it had the plausible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Elder Times</hi> of <hi>Christianity;</hi> And yet, that it was an Essential part of the <hi>Apostasie,</hi> and was his own <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue;</hi> and that in Regard of it in its own proper Time, The 144000 were <hi>Seal▪d</hi> as soon as ever <hi>Heathenism</hi> was Demolish'd; and the <hi>Churches Flight</hi> into the <hi>Wilderness</hi> was declar'd, as soon as ever the <hi>Manly Child</hi> was <hi>Caught</hi> up to the <hi>Throne of God,</hi> both importing the very beginning of that <hi>Christian Empire;</hi> And also that it was Guilded over with his so ofte prov'd, Successful <hi>Temptation;</hi> the <hi>Glory of this world</hi> going along with it; wherein his <hi>Kingdom</hi> so much consists.</p>
               <p>God now leaving the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> to themselves, as at large, and in general, to <hi>prove Them,</hi> and to <hi>See,</hi> what was in their <hi>Hearts; Sathan</hi> so prevail'd, that his <hi>Synagogue</hi> was Recommenc'd by a <hi>(They)</hi> that took the part of it, as not of the <hi>Apostasie,</hi> but of the <hi>Primitive, pure Christianity;</hi> Hereby the <hi>Beast</hi> hath some Appearance of his own <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie,</hi> as anew, but so Refracted, and Attenuated; that while it is his <hi>Synagogue,</hi> it is not his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and He Hates it, divided from that: And there is a Resemblance in the <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,</hi> even of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> of the <hi>Feet</hi> of <hi>Clay;</hi> but yet They are not those <hi>Feet;</hi> And the <hi>Witnesses</hi> even under this <hi>Synagogue,</hi> as <hi>Philadelphian,</hi> though not as <hi>Reform'd Witnesses</hi> have been under <hi>Sufferings,</hi> Incredible to be Inflicted by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed powers,</hi> either <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastic;</hi> had not this <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Sathan</hi> Impos'd upon them.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:100645:46"/>
               <p> All this notwithstanding, the <hi>Reformation,</hi> even by the <hi>(They)</hi> of this <hi>Synagogue,</hi> as both <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> hath shown us, hath been secur'd; as we are now to Behold, by strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comparing the <hi>Prophetical</hi> mentions of this <hi>Synagogue</hi> in the <hi>Church of Smyrna,</hi> and in the Church of <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know, saith Christ to the <hi>Church of Smyrna,</hi> the <hi>Blasphemy</hi> of <hi>Them,</hi> which say, <hi>They are Jews,</hi> and <hi>are not;</hi> But They are the <hi>Synagogue of Sathan.</hi> To the <hi>Church of Philadelphia</hi> Christ speaks thus, I will make <hi>Them</hi> of the <hi>Synagogue of Sathan;</hi> the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Them,</hi> as is to be supplyed, or as in a <hi>Parenthesis, who say, They are Jews,</hi> and <hi>are not,</hi> but <hi>do Lye;</hi> Behold <hi>I will make them to come, and Worship,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Interpretation I give of these Two speakings of Christ is; That in the first, there was the proper <hi>Synagogue of Sathan</hi> in its own just Time, and order, before the <hi>Throne,</hi> and before the <hi>Depths</hi> of <hi>Sathan;</hi> In the Latter Christ only speaks of Them, who were on the side, of the Justifying party of that <hi>Syagogue,</hi> as if it were not a <hi>Synagogue of Sathan,</hi> but the <hi>Church</hi> pure.</p>
               <p>And for such Interpretation I give this Proof, The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian Apostasie</hi> is one entire Thing with it self; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of those only, whose <hi>Names</hi> are not <hi>Written in the Lambs Book</hi> of <hi>Life;</hi> They were therefore in the first <hi>Workings</hi> of the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi> Time; in <hi>Ephesus</hi> Leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its <hi>First Love,</hi> in <hi>Smyrna's Synagogue, Sathans Throne,</hi> and <hi>Thyatyra's depths of Sathan;</hi> One entire <hi>Body,</hi> and of one <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> so far, as they could either reach forward, or take hold backward; as the <hi>Papists</hi> do this day, contending so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all backward to the <hi>Apostles</hi> Times are their own; and All, in whom was the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Apostasie,</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed so; They that were so many Ages backward, Reach'd forward by the <hi>Spirit of Apostasie</hi> to the <hi>Throne</hi> and <hi>Depths;</hi> But good Men in All Ages, however in some part deceiv'd, yet in the main <hi>Overcame</hi> and were not of that <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Apostasie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, They who have Liv'd since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and look at present on the <hi>Depths of Sathan,</hi> and abhor them; and on the <hi>Throne of Sathan</hi> backward, and at present, and utterly detest it; Although They are Deceiv'd in Allowing too much of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and in being too much upon the side and part of vindicating it in such Things.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100645:47"/> Yet they cannot be the <hi>Synagogue of Sathan</hi> it self; Because who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is so, must be now professedly of All these together; of the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> leaving the <hi>First Love of Christians,</hi> of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> in All Things, of the <hi>Throne,</hi> of the <hi>Depths:</hi> And none can Return to <hi>Rome,</hi> and be, as They call it, <hi>Reconcil'd;</hi> But They must be All together; As Christ speaks of <hi>Swearing</hi> in another Case, so I may in this; They must <hi>Swear</hi> to the <hi>Throne,</hi> and to <hi>Him that sitteth thereon;</hi> to the <hi>Jezebelian Church,</hi> and to all therein; They that will go no further, then to the <hi>Synagogue</hi> shall be <hi>Damn'd for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> by the <hi>Throne,</hi> and by the <hi>Depths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I understand those words, who say, <hi>They are Jews, &amp;c.</hi> as a Description in a <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> of that <hi>Synagogue,</hi>

                  <hi>(who say, They are Jews,</hi> and <hi>are not,</hi> but <hi>do Lye,)</hi> as giving Account, what deceiv'd those of the <hi>Reformation</hi> to be of the part of this <hi>Synagogue;</hi> Because that <hi>Synagogue Lyed</hi> in pretending to have Receiv'd Those Things from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which they never did; And the Reason, why what is call'd <hi>Blasphemies</hi> in the <hi>Church of Smyrna</hi> is only call'd a <hi>Lye</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is this; <hi>Blasphemy</hi> is the <hi>Prophetical</hi> word for <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> which as it began to Appear in <hi>Invocation,</hi> and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Images,</hi> and <hi>Relicks;</hi> Even These of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> reject, and do not justifie it in; But every humane mixture, and Addition to <hi>Worship,</hi> not commanded is a <hi>Lye,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> Admonishes; <hi>Add</hi> not to his <hi>Words,</hi> least <hi>Thou</hi> be <hi>Found</hi> a <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Lyar,</hi> and Additions they too much justifie.</p>
               <p>But further, to Inlighten this shade, and to shew, that I have a sincere Love, and Honour for All of the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by what <hi>Names,</hi> or Titles soever, as <hi>Reform'd,</hi> they are <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished;</hi> though I endeavour thus close to Follow and to Lay together the <hi>Prophetical Types</hi> of it in hope and desire of that Great <hi>Re-Reformation;</hi> I therefore add these <hi>Prophetic</hi> Notes in favour of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I observe, <hi>Sardis,</hi> in the larger, and more General com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of it, is Reprov▪d very severely by Chrisi; and its <hi>Fewer,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">For the Over-rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Greatest were also the most.</note>
                  <hi>Smaller Names</hi> are commended; And yet to shew, They made both one <hi>True Church</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> The larger, and more faulty <hi>Sardis</hi> is said to <hi>have the Fewer, Smaller,</hi> and <hi>Better</hi> within it self; Contrary wise <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and <hi>Thyatyra,</hi> that were the <hi>Churches in the Wilderness,</hi> and the <hi>Witnesses</hi> in <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> and so alone as a <hi>Beacon</hi> on a <hi>Hill,</hi> are
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100645:47"/> said, one to <hi>Have,</hi> and the other to <hi>Suffer,</hi> that large, and wide Spreading, False <hi>Apostate,</hi> call'd <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> as a <hi>Schisme, Faction,</hi> and <hi>Heresie,</hi> whether they would or no; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God how <hi>Small,</hi> how <hi>Hidden</hi> soever, own'd no <hi>Church</hi> besides them, the few are the <hi>Church</hi> there, but not here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I observe, though by all as hath been said, the [They] of the <hi>-Synagogue</hi> must be suppos'd to Rise from <hi>Sardis;</hi> Yet for Honors sake to it, It is not mention'd in the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or <hi>Epistle</hi> of Christ to it, but in that to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> so clear from it, as to have separated wholly from it; as if Christ would not have it known, from whence it arose.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I observe, where that <hi>Apostasie</hi> only was, either <hi>Had,</hi> or <hi>Suffer'd;</hi> though the True <hi>Church</hi> could not vindicate it self, and so the <hi>Having,</hi> or <hi>Suffering</hi> are imputed only, as <hi>Small Things;</hi> Yet on purpose to make Infamous that <hi>Apostasie,</hi> the Excellent <hi>Symbolic Witness Churches,</hi> to which Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses yet so Great Love, and Esteem, are Blam'd; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the <hi>Few undefiled Names</hi> in <hi>Sardis,</hi> are Tax'd for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Defilements of Sardis;</hi> Nor is <hi>Philadelphia</hi> Blam'd for <hi>Them</hi> of the <hi>Synagogue;</hi> shewing that neither <hi>Sardis,</hi> nor <hi>They of the Synagogue</hi> were under the <hi>Apostasie,</hi> though the <hi>Synagogue</hi> it self, as hath been shewn, was under the <hi>Apostasie,</hi> even as <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I observe, whereas the <hi>Apostasie</hi> is devoted to Ruin, and goeth into <hi>Perdition; Sardis</hi> is only Threatned with Christ coming upon it, and shaming its <hi>Defiled</hi> State into <hi>Repentance,</hi> and a fuller <hi>Reformation;</hi> as Persons are Asham'd of <hi>Defiled Garments,</hi> or <hi>walking naked;</hi> and so obtains of Christ to be <hi>Cloathed</hi> in <hi>White Rayment,</hi> by <hi>Overcoming</hi> at the last, even as in a <hi>Church state.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And even <hi>They of the Synagogue</hi> are only mention'd, as coming under that second <hi>Reformation,</hi> and <hi>Conforming</hi> to <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> whose <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Synagogue</hi> before they had so severely urg'd, and <hi>Confess</hi> that <hi>Christ loved it;</hi> when They would have <hi>Excommunicated,</hi> and <hi>shut its Door;</hi> and so undoubtedly must be asham'd, that they had been so Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon with the false Appearances of that <hi>Synagogue,</hi> whose Authority They would have impos'd on <hi>Philadelphia</hi> also.</p>
               <p>But none of these Things take off from the sin, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of persons, who do not <hi>Overcome;</hi> For They sink down in their Individuals into the sin, and <hi>Perdition</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:100645:48"/> of the <hi>Apostafie;</hi> although the <hi>Church state</hi> be so Rescued by Grace; For the best <hi>Church state</hi> can redeem no particular person from destruction, who does not by the divine spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>Overcome;</hi> Even as no <hi>Church state,</hi> how bad so ever, shall wrap up in its own ruin the person, that is by being an <hi>Overcomer snatch'd</hi> out of that <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>pull'd</hi> as a <hi>Brand</hi> from that <hi>Burning;</hi> which sets the Beam even, as to Good men, though somewhat Blacken'd with being in the <hi>Tents of Kedar;</hi> and as to bad Men, who in a <hi>Land of Ʋprightness deal Perversly,</hi> and will not <hi>Behold the Majesty of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>Philadelphia</hi> it self is Admonish'd to <hi>Hold fast,</hi> that <hi>None</hi> may <hi>Take its Crown;</hi> which seeing the <hi>Church state</hi> is by Christ so secur'd, is especially an Admonition to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, not only in particular, but even in their Generality; Least They become <hi>Dead, Languid,</hi> and <hi>Formal</hi> in their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession;</hi> least They grow Sensual, Carnal, and vain-Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Spiritually proud, or <hi>Lovers</hi> of the <hi>Present world,</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in their <hi>Spirits, Manners,</hi> and <hi>Fashions</hi> to it; least They are Rigid, Consorious, even above Christ Himself, towards <hi>Sardis,</hi> and <hi>Them of the Synagogue;</hi> whom Christ will convert and not destroy. For thus though the <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian</hi> State it self, shall never have its <hi>Door shut;</hi> The <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> shall <hi>come down upon</hi> it; Yet an Age, a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, a Time of such persons may be Thrust out, and others taken into their places; even into the same <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian</hi> State, which they were of; and so great <hi>Numbers may Lose the Crown</hi> of the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> coming down upon them as their peculiar Glory; nay, and if they do not <hi>Overcome,</hi> may loose for ever their portion in it; For many such <hi>First</hi> are <hi>Last,</hi> and the <hi>Last First,</hi> even many such <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> may be <hi>Thrust out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly that <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> hath not yet <hi>come down,</hi> nor been given, because <hi>Philadelphia</hi> it self in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent State, or in the persons, and <hi>Churches</hi> of that <hi>Name,</hi> is not high as it ought to be, and clear in the Power of the <hi>Thunders;</hi> and particularly in searching the <hi>Prophecy</hi> and declaring the <hi>Everlasting Gospel,</hi> or the <hi>Hour</hi> of the <hi>Judgment</hi> of Christ, or of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> near at Hand. Nay, it may be fear'd by Them, They are so degenerate from the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian</hi> Power, Spirituality, Brotherly Love, Holiness, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venliness, Strictness of Conversation, Mortification, self-denial;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100645:48"/> That <hi>many</hi> shall <hi>come</hi> from <hi>East,</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> from <hi>Thyatyra,</hi> even from <hi>Sardis</hi> and from them of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and enter into the <hi>Philadelpoian</hi> state, and They may be, if not <hi>Overcomers, Thrust out;</hi> and if They are <hi>Overcomers,</hi> if not so Spiritual, and Truly zealous of the Things of the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> They may yet be Postpond.</p>
               <p>It is very hopeful; Many of those Venerable, Learned, and Holy men; who as yet stand on the side of the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,</hi> may when They come to be Inlightned in the <hi>Love</hi> of Christ to the <hi>Philadelphian state;</hi> and so Humbly, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately to <hi>Worship,</hi> as before the <hi>Feet</hi> of Christ Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that <hi>Church; Labour more Abundantly,</hi> then <hi>They All,</hi> of it before; as <hi>Born out of due Time,</hi> or too late into it, but therefore of speedier, and more sudden growth up, then those before them; and shall as the <hi>Labourers</hi> call'd at the <hi>Last Hour,</hi> be so Accepted by Christ, and bring so much <hi>Glory</hi> to his <hi>Grace,</hi> as to be <hi>Set,</hi> even before Those, who have <hi>Borne the Heat</hi> of the <hi>Day</hi> in the <hi>Philadelphian state;</hi> For the Fountain of all Grace may <hi>do what He will with his Own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus may it be with the <hi>Persons,</hi> but so it can never be with the <hi>State;</hi> For the <hi>Synagogue</hi> shall Fall down with the <hi>Throne,</hi> and with the <hi>Depths,</hi> to which it is united; All up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own <hi>Base</hi> in the Land of <hi>Mystical Shinar,</hi> or <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> and the <hi>Sardian</hi> state in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> projected from this <hi>Synagogue</hi> shall be suddenly deserted, They of it leaving <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianism</hi> behind shall fly into <hi>Philadelphianism,</hi> as persons <hi>Naked,</hi> or in <hi>defiled Garments</hi> into <hi>White Rayment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus, what I have undertaken upon these Two great <hi>Visions</hi> of <hi>c.</hi> 10. and upon these <hi>Churches, Thyatyra, Sardis,</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> as They stand in this <hi>Prophecy</hi> a Table of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</hi> I have <hi>according to the Grace given to me, Finish'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I Confess, If <hi>Providence</hi> should not bring forth Events answering these <hi>Types,</hi> It would be a Confutation to my Exposition of them. And it is the only Confutation, an Exposition Grounded upon such Admirable Correspondences of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> also, (thus far) can receive; From whence I am Humbly confident such a Confutation shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be given. And what is said, If it be of God, however des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable it may be on all other Accounts; It will prove True, and all that can be said against it, will be of no Force; For

                  <hi>Coroll.</hi> 1. We ought not to wonder, that Things are so Low, as we yet see Them, either in the State of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> or in the <hi>Keformation;</hi> Because The <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> is not yet in its <hi>Succession;</hi> Then <hi>Christianity,</hi> and the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as United into one pure Religion shall Rise, and be still Rising into Full Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coroll.</hi> 2. Let us look upon the Original State of each <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church</hi> in the world, or upon it, at its First <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian;</hi> and then consider those <hi>Churches</hi> as they are at this day; and we shall have Reason to believe, They then, whilest the <hi>Thunders</hi> were <hi>Speaking,</hi> and the <hi>Book open,</hi> Took that Form; which they have most since, notwithstanding some Waves, and Checkerings of the Clouds, Retain'd, and shall Retain, till the <hi>Thunders</hi> are <hi>Ʋnsealed,</hi> and the <hi>Book</hi> again <hi>Open;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Thyatyrian, Sardian,</hi> in the general, or in the <hi>Few Ʋndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Names,</hi> or <hi>Philadelphian;</hi> Then by those mighty powers, working anew, and a Fresh, They shall be <hi>Reform'd,</hi> even <hi>Phyladelphia</hi> it self into a much Higher State.</p>

                  <hi>Coroll.</hi> 3. Whatever Preparatory motions may Fly, as in the Air; yet we have Reason to believe, the Grand <hi>Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> in <hi>Succession</hi> can be neither sooner, nor Later, than 1697. by Considering this <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> at the <hi>Morning</hi> of <hi>Half Time,</hi> whiie it was <hi>yet dark;</hi> as being the Hundred, and Eightieth Year, or the just <hi>Half Time,</hi> from 1517. when the <hi>Reformation</hi> first Broke, as in the <hi>Twilight</hi> of the <hi>Morning,</hi> in <hi>Luthers Ministery.</hi>

                  <hi>Coroll.</hi> 4. It is no Argument: The <hi>Synagogue of Sathan</hi> hath no place in such, or such Illustrious <hi>Churches of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> either <hi>Lutheran,</hi> or others; Because even <hi>They of the Synagogue</hi> are most zealous against the <hi>Popish Apostasie,</hi> and because together with that zeal in regard of outward strength, and favour, with <hi>Puissant Princes</hi> any <hi>Church</hi> may be call'd the <hi>Bulwark of the Protestant Religion.</hi> For so <hi>They of the Synagogue</hi> are according to this <hi>Prophecy</hi> to be; For the <hi>Apostasie</hi> now is not only a <hi>Synagogue,</hi> but a <hi>Throne,</hi> and an <hi>Ancient Polity</hi> call'd the <hi>Roman Catholik Church;</hi> And They, who cannot be for the <hi>Throne,</hi> and for the <hi>Polity,</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Roman Church,</hi> can never be now for the <hi>Apostasie,</hi> as to their <hi>Church State;</hi> Now <hi>They of the Synagogue</hi> are Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, and as I may say, staunched there by <hi>Prophecy;</hi> and can go no further, nor higher that way; and so must be as Irreconcilable Enemies to the <hi>Apostasie,</hi> as <hi>Philadelphta</hi> it self; and so according to <hi>Prophecy</hi> These have prov'd, which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Observation exceedingly justifies this Interpretation of it.</p>
               <p>And yet even these persons, may have a zeal also for this <hi>Synagogue;</hi> and however They may be admirably Learn'd, it may not be in this particular a <hi>Zeal</hi> according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coroll.</hi> 5. We have here fix'd the lowest State, to which the <hi>Reformation</hi> can descend, as to the purity of its <hi>Church States;</hi> None of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> can <hi>worship</hi> the <hi>Beast,</hi> or his <hi>Image,</hi> or <hi>Receive his mark</hi> on their <hi>Forehead,</hi> or <hi>Right Hand,</hi> or <hi>His Name,</hi> or so much, as the <hi>Number of his Name;</hi> as some have much mistaken; For even that Imports <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> or the <hi>Worship of Images;</hi> which no <hi>Reformed Church</hi> can bear; nor can They be that <hi>Synagogue of Sathan,</hi> nor so much as of it, as it is <hi>His,</hi> or as united with <hi>His Throne,</hi> or with <hi>His Depths;</hi> But They are only of it, or on the part of it, or vindicating it as not <hi>His;</hi> in which point They are indeed mistaken; For <hi>Prophecy</hi> hath determin'd, It is <hi>His;</hi> and therefore they must let it go for the <hi>Philadelphian State,</hi> and Resign it up to Him, whose <hi>Prophecy</hi> saith, It is, when that perfect <hi>Reformation</hi> shall be.</p>

                  <hi>Coroll.</hi> 6. It is therefore a great want of deep Insight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Prophecy,</hi> so much, as to suppose; that any part of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> can return to <hi>Rome;</hi> For what is Rescued by Christ, can never be Repriz'd by <hi>Antichrist,</hi> so far as it is Rescued. I speak not of <hi>Persons,</hi> but of <hi>States;</hi> For <hi>Persons</hi> are under another <hi>Type of Prophecy, viz.</hi> as <hi>Overcomers,</hi> or not <hi>Overcomers;</hi> States are under <hi>Types of Churches</hi> fix'd in

                  <hi>Coroll.</hi> 7. Here is Reason to cry out; Oh the <hi>Depth of the Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God in this State of the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> on These Two Accounts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In suffering <hi>Antichrist</hi> to have such a Footing upon the <hi>Reformatien,</hi> with Regard to the <hi>Oath of Christ;</hi> That He should have <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half Time;</hi> He hath so much therefore, as that some of the <hi>Reformation</hi> should be on the side of his <hi>Synagogue,</hi> as if it were not his <hi>Synagogue:</hi> And yet because it was Lawful for the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in such <hi>Symbols,</hi> and the <hi>Thunders to open their Mouths;</hi> It is no more, It can be no more, then such a Being on the side of that <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and not an entire <hi>Antichristian Kingdom,</hi> or so much, as the <hi>Synagogue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the weakest, and darkest part of the <hi>Reformation</hi> should▪ (according to the Great Sanction, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26.)

               <p>
                  <hi>Coroll.</hi> 8. It is most necessary to Persons to look to their particular <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Overcoming;</hi> For Men may be of the most excellent Church-state, and not be <hi>Overcomers;</hi> and in every <hi>Church-state,</hi> there are <hi>Overcomers</hi> of the Evil of that State; Many now of the part of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> even as of old, are much above the spirit of it; And it is as necessary to <hi>Overcome</hi> in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> as in <hi>Sardis;</hi> And the priviledges are equal to the <hi>Overcomers</hi> in one, as in the other; All are of deep Interest in the <hi>New Jerusalem state;</hi> And in every State, whoever <hi>Overcometh</hi> shall <hi>Inherit All Things;</hi> He that <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh,</hi> saith, <hi>He that sits on the Throne,</hi> shall <hi>Inherit All Things;</hi> And I will be his <hi>Father,</hi> and He shall be my <hi>Son;</hi> They, who do not <hi>Overcome,</hi> whatever <hi>Church state▪</hi> They are of, are the <hi>Fearful,</hi> and <hi>Ʋnbelieving, &amp;c.</hi> who shall have their <hi>part in the Lake.</hi>

Let him that desires to search the Great <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi> of <hi>Prophecy</hi> retire Himself; He that would behold the <hi>Apostasie,</hi> as <hi>Prophecy</hi> hath drawn it, and be perswaded of it, must be <hi>Carried away,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> was, by <hi>the spirit into the Wilderness;</hi> For the very world, even the <hi>Reformed world</hi> is so Full of it, He will certainly be deceiv'd concerning it; except He be so withdrawn from the Manners, and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments also of it; He that would behold the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>Glory of Jesus Christ,</hi> must be <hi>Carried up by the Spirit</hi> with <hi>John</hi> also into an exceeding <hi>High Mountain;</hi> For if He remain upon Earth, He will be Lost in the <hi>Vulgar Errour;</hi> That that <hi>Kingdom</hi> is no other, but as it now rises up in the world with all the <hi>Sardian Glory,</hi> that surrounds it; and the <hi>Hierarchic</hi> Grandieur, that Ecclipses it, while it pretends to bear its Glory openly, and on High; Although it be indeed no other, then the Print, the <hi>Feet of Iron,</hi> and of <hi>Clay</hi> have left behind them: But we <hi>wait,</hi> and <hi>look</hi> for the <hi>Lord from Heaven,</hi> and for <hi>new Heavens</hi> and a <hi>new Earth,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Righteousness shall dwell;</hi> to be created by Him, who shall make <hi>All Things new,</hi> when He <hi>comes;</hi> and when the <hi>Days</hi> of <hi>Refreshment,</hi> or Breathing in that purest Air shall <hi>come</hi> from the <hi>Face of God and of the Lamb;</hi> and in the <hi>Times of Restitution,</hi> when the <hi>Mystery,</hi> that <hi>God hath Preach'd</hi> as an <hi>Everlasting Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> by <hi>all his Prophets,</hi> shall be <hi>Finish'd;</hi> And it shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon it, <hi>IT IS DONE.</hi>
